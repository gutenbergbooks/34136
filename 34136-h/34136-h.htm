<h3>THE PHILANTHROPISTS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was to Pipette that the idea originally occurred,
but it was upon Pip that parental retribution
subsequently fell, Pipette being merely
dismissed with a caution. This clemency was
due chiefly to the intercession of Cook, who
stated, in the r√¥le of principal witness, that the
"poor lamb" (Pipette) "could never have
thought of such a thing by herself." This in spite
of the poor lamb's indignant protests to the contrary.
In this matter, as in many others, Cook
showed both personal bias and want of judgment;
for Pipette was as sharp as a needle, while Pip,
though a willing accomplice and a philosophical
scapegoat, was lacking in constructive ability
and organising power.</p>

<p class="indent">But we have somehow begun at the end of the
story, so must make a fresh start.</p>

<p class="indent">The Consulting Room, which was strictly out
of bounds (and consequently a favourite resort of
the children when the big, silent man, who kissed
them twice a day, was out), contained many
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
absorbingly interesting and mysterious objects,
whose uses Pip and Pipette were dying to know.
For instance, there was the Oven Door. It was
set in the wall near the fireplace, miles up,&mdash;quite
five feet,&mdash;and was exactly like the oven
in the kitchen, except that it was green instead of
black. Also, it had a beautiful gold handle. It
was not hot, though, for one day Pip climbed on
a chair to feel; neither did it open, for he was
unable to turn the handle.</p>

<p class="indent">They had asked Mr. Evans about it, and he
had informed them that it was a place to put bad
little boys and girls in. But that was on a day
when Mr. Evans was cross, having just had words
with Cook about the disgraceful delay between
the fish and joint at last night's dinner. Pipette,
therefore, outwardly incredulous but inwardly
quaking, appealed to Cook, and asked confidentially
if the strange thing were not an oven;
whereupon Cook embraced her and presented
her with an apple, and wondered what the little
precious would get into her poor head next,
adding as an afterthought that Mr. Evans ought
to be ashamed of himself. Pipette was so pleased
with the apple and the task of conveying Cook's
message to Mr. Evans's pantry&mdash;this was the
name of the place where he lived; there was a
delightful thing there called the Filter, with a
little tap that you could turn on if no one was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
looking&mdash;that she quite forgot to ask what the
Oven Door really was; so the mystery remained
unsolved for many a day.</p>

<p class="indent">There were other wonderful things lying about.
Books in plenty (but then books are dull things
if you don't happen to be able to read), and two
or three curious little articles like wooden trumpets,
called "stuffyscopes." It was impossible to
play tunes on these, though, and they puzzled
the children sorely, until one joyful day when
Pipette was taken with a cold on her chest, and
Father&mdash;the name of the big, silent man who
kissed them twice a day&mdash;took her into the
Consulting Room and used one of those very
instruments "to listen to my tummy wiv," as
she afterwards explained to the envious Pip,
who had not been permitted to be present.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did it hurt much?" inquired Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not <i>bewwy</i> much," replied Pipette, unwilling
to throw away a good chance of posing as a
martyr. "He putted one end against his ear
and the other against my pinny, and said, 'Hold
your breff,' and I holded it. Pip, I've thought
of a lovely game! Let's see who can hold our
breff longest."</p>

<p class="indent">This suggestion was adopted, and the new
game kept them occupied for quite ten minutes.
After that Pipette surrendered unconditionally.
To hold your tongue is bad enough, but to hold
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
your breath as well, in competition with a small,
silent boy with a solemn face, serious eyes, and
lungs apparently of gutta-percha, who seems to
suffer no inconvenience from feats of endurance
that would exhaust a Red Indian, is more than
a mere daughter of Eve can compass.</p>

<p class="indent">They were in the Consulting Room at the
time, Father having gone out, as he always did
between eleven and one; and the various unexplained
mysteries of that delightful apartment,
which were becoming a serious strain upon
Pipette's feminine curiosity, once more lay before
them. For the hundredth time they made
the tour of the room, gazing, fingering, and
wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">They merely sighed as they passed the Oven
Door. That mysterious portal was past all comprehension.
They had made one last effort to
obtain first-hand information on the subject only
last night, with highly unsatisfactory results.
They were always taken to the dining-room at
half-past seven to say good-night to Father, who
to his numerous other eccentricities added that of
eating his dinner at an hour when properly constituted
people were going to bed. (Pip's rather
hazy scheme of theology, imbibed in scraps from
Cook and others, included a private heaven of
his own construction, in which at bedtime little
boys, instead of being hustled upstairs by an
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
under-housemaid, sat down to a heavy dinner of
several courses.) On this occasion the pair had
entered the dining-room bound by the most
deadly oaths known to childhood to break down
their shyness, and ask once and for all what lay
behind the Oven Door. But alas! desire outran
performance, and both&mdash;all three, in fact&mdash;made
a sorry mess of things. The big man, almost
as shy of them as they were of him, asked
Pip, heavily but kindly, how he had spent the
afternoon; not because he wished to know, but
because the question afforded a conversational
opening. Pip replied politely that he had been
down the street posting a letter with "one of the
girls." He used the expression in all good faith:
his firm friend the milkman cried it down the
area every afternoon in some such form as,
"Anything fresh to-day, girls?" or, "Well, girls,
what news?" The big man, however, frowned,
and said, "Come, come, sir, no kitchen manners
here, if you please," and turned to Pipette, who,
with a boldness surprising to herself, was endeavouring
to climb on to his knee.</p>

<p class="indent">Having reached that eminence, Pipette, assuming
a certain coaxing expression which she
had found absolutely infallible with Cook, and
not without a certain effect on Mr. Evans himself,
said rather tremulously&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, Father, is that oven door in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Kersultin' Room <i>reelly</i> a oven, or is it just&mdash;just
to put bad little boys and girls in, like what
Mr. Evans says?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Evans, who up to this point had been
standing in the background, listening to the
conversation with an indulgent smile, suddenly
remembered that it was time to bring the fish up.</p>

<p class="indent">Her father glanced down upon Pipette curiously.
He looked tired and worried, as West-End
physicians with enormous practices not infrequently
do.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean by 'oven door'? And
what's all this nonsense about <i>Mr.</i> Evans?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette began to quail. This big man was
cross about something, just like Mr. Evans
when he had "indergestion." Her lip began to
tremble.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn't fink it would make you angry," she
said rather piteously. "It was just that big oven
door in the Kersultin' Room. Me and Pip wanted
to know so much, and there wasn't nobody to
ask, exceptin' Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Here Father, much to Pipette's surprise and
embarrassment, suddenly hugged her to his
breast, murmuring the while to himself. Then
he kissed her twice,&mdash;as a rule she kissed him
once,&mdash;shook hands solemnly with Pip, and
despatched them to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">The children had no nurse. The last holder of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
that position had left soon after their mother's
death, and Cook had begged so hard to be allowed
to take care of the "little dears" herself,
that Father, who was too deeply sunk in the apathy
of grief to desire to haggle over questions of
domestic management, listlessly agreed. Since
then Pip and Pipette had been washed, dressed,
fed, and bedded by a syndicate composed of
Cook and her myrmidons, who brought them
up according to their own notions of respectability.
Emily, the kitchen-maid, for instance,
made no objection to Pip stirring his tea with the
handle of his knife; but what shocked her ideas
of etiquette and deportment was the fact that he
insisted on doing so with his left hand. Somehow
Pip's left hand was always getting him into
trouble. It was so officious; it was constantly
usurping the duties and privileges of its fellow,
such as cleaning his teeth, shaking hands, and
blowing his nose,&mdash;literal acts of <i>gaucherie</i> that
distressed Emily's genteel soul considerably.</p>

<p class="indent">After the children had gone Father sat staring
at his untasted dinner. Occasionally his gaze
travelled to the opposite end of the table, where
some one used to sit,&mdash;some one who had been
taken from him by an inscrutable Providence
five years before. Had she lived, Pip would not
have referred to the kitchen-maid as "one of the
girls," nor would Pipette be calling the butler
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
"Mr. Evans." All these years he had been trying
to hide his desolation by burying himself in his
work, with the result that he now found himself
busy,&mdash;overworked, in fact,&mdash;rich, and famous,
a man at the head of his profession. <i>Cui
bono?</i> His children, whom he had promised his
dying Dorothea to love and cherish, were learning
to venerate the butler and to converse in the
jargon of the scullery!</p>

<p class="indent">So the Oven Door had to remain an unsolved
mystery, and Pip and Pipette were compelled to
comfort themselves with the Talking-Hole. This
was a most absorbing affair, and, thank goodness!
it was no mystery.</p>

<p class="indent">The Talking-Hole was carefully plugged with
a whistle; and whenever a visitor came to see
Father,&mdash;they came in shoals between one
o'clock and three,&mdash;Mr. Evans would uncork a
similar hole in the wall of the hall, and after
blowing up it vigorously, would murmur the
name of the visitor; and his words, owing to the
fact that the Talking-Hole in the hall was in some
mysterious way connected with the Talking-Hole
in the Consulting Room, were conveyed to
Father's ear. The conversation as a rule was of
a formal and fragmentary nature, limited on
Mr. Evans's part to the announcement of the
visitor's name and some such remark as "Special
appointment," or "No appointment," and occasionally,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
"Urgent case,"&mdash;always concluding
with "Very good, sir." After that Mr. Evans
would conduct the visitor up the three carpeted
stairs which led to the Consulting Room.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip and Pipette loved the Talking-Hole. It
was almost their only toy, and it was the more
precious to them because they could not use it
except when Father was out and Mr. Evans
taking his afternoon siesta. Their one child-friend,
Tattie Fowler, who was occasionally
brought to spend the afternoon with them when
her nurse had made arrangements to spend it
elsewhere, was always regaled with a full-dress
performance whenever she came.</p>

<p class="indent">The method of procedure was invariably the
same. The children knew every move by heart.
The moment that Mr. Evans, having closed the
front door on Father, had closed his bedroom
door upon himself, Pip would stalk with much
majesty into the Consulting Room, shutting the
door carefully behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">After an interval of about one second, Tattie,
endeavouring faithfully to imitate Mr. Evans's
stately tread,&mdash;have you ever seen a kitten trying
to walk like an elephant, reader?&mdash;would
approach the Talking-Hole in the hall, uncork
the tube, and despatch an excited hurricane on
its way to the Consulting Room. The following
dialogue would then ensue:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span><i>A gruff voice down the tube.</i> Well?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tattie</i> [<i>reading from an imaginary card</i>]. Mr. Henry
Hatkins, sir! (This, by the way, happened to be the
name of Tattie's nurse's "young man.")</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Voice.</i> Any appointment?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tattie.</i> None, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Voice.</i> What's the matter wiv him?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tattie.</i> Infruenza, <i>he</i> thinks, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Voice.</i> Send him up.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tattie.</i> Very good, sir.</p></div>

<p class="indent">Then Tattie would cork up the tube and conduct
Pipette, who had been sitting patiently in
the Waiting Room, up the three stairs to the
Consulting Room. Here she abruptly dropped
the r√¥le of Mr. Evans, and announced firmly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, Pip, it's my turn to be Father!"</p>

<p class="indent">(Tattie had no father of her own, and imagined
that the term merely implied a large, silent man
who lived in a room full of fascinating playthings,
opening Oven Doors and blowing down Talking-Holes.)</p>

<p class="indent">After that Pip would be the patient, Pipette
Mr. Evans, and Tattie Father, and the performance
was repeated <i>in extenso</i>. Pipette, as the
youngest, succeeded to the proud position of
"Father" last of all.</p>

<p class="indent">Each of them played the leading part in different
fashion. Pip, enjoying every moment of his
impersonation, always sat solemnly in the big
swivel-chair at the table until the whistle blew,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
when he would lounge across to the Talking-Hole
and conduct the conversation as deliberately
as possible. Pipette, on the other hand,
possessed none of this artistic restraint, and was
always standing on a chair, with her small ear
ecstatically pressed against the mouth of the
tube, by the time that Pip, in the character of
Mr. Evans, was ready to converse with her.
Consequently his withering blast, when it arrived,
impinged straight upon Pipette's eardrum,
frequently knocking her off her chair and
invariably dulling her hearing for the afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent">Considerable freedom, too, was permitted in
the interpretation of the part of Mr. Evans,
especially in describing the patients' symptoms.
In this respect the children were compelled to
draw chiefly upon their own somewhat slight experience;
for Mr. Evans, though he invariably
gave the patients' names, was not as a rule entrusted
with their complaints as well. Consequently
the maladies which were shrieked up the
tube so gleefully were those indigenous to small
children, cooks and the like. When introduced
by Pipette, the patient was usually suffering from
"palpurtations, that bad!" (an echo of Cook);
Tattie, whose pretty and interesting mamma
affected fashionable complaints, would diagnose
the case in hand as "nerves all in a jangle
again"; while Pip, who was lacking in imagination
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
but possessed a retentive memory, invariably
announced, with feeling, that the visitor
was a victim of a "<i>fearful</i> pain in his (or her)
tummy!"</p>

<p class="indent">Near the Talking-Hole, on a small table, stood
"The Terriphone." This, they gathered, was a
sort of long-distance talking-hole. You turned
a little handle, and, taking a queer, cup-shaped
arrangement off a hook, conversed affably
through it with unseen people, situated somewhere
at the back of beyond. The children had
seen Mr. Evans use it for sending messages to
Father <i>via</i> Mr. Pipes. Mr. Pipes was a great
friend of Pipette's. In the first place, he wore a
uniform, which always appeals to the feminine
mind. Then he lived in a fascinating little glass
house at the gates of a great building called "The
Orspital," where Father apparently spent much
of his time. In the courtyard inside the gates
bareheaded young men passed to and fro, discoursing
learnedly of mysterious things called
"Ops." Mr. Pipes wore two medals on his uniform,
but beyond these there was nothing very
attractive in the glass house excepting the Terriphone,
which stood on a little ledge beside the
pigeon-hole. Mr. Pipes, being attached to Emily,
the under-housemaid, was always glad to see the
children when it was that engaging damsel's turn
to take them for a walk. From him they learned
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
one day that his Terriphone communicated with
the one at home, quite three streets away.</p>

<p class="indent">"It must be a long hole," remarked Pip reflectively
to his sister.</p>

<p class="indent">The conversation then turned upon the
weather. Mr. Pipes announced to the sympathetic
Emily that, as a result of having to sit all
day in a blooming greenhouse, his feet were
slowly turning to ice. The authorities of the
Orspital, he added bitterly, declined to allow him
a fire, alleging that an oil-stove was sufficient for
his needs.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a shime!" said pretty Emily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Something crool!" exclaimed sympathetic
Pipette. (She had picked up this expression from
Susan, the kitchen-maid, who was regarded by
her colleagues as being somewhat "common in
her talk.")</p>

<p class="indent">"Pore devil!" remarked Pip dispassionately.</p>

<p class="indent">"Master Pip!" cried the scandalised Emily,
blushing in a manner which Mr. Pipes thought
most becoming.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who had just gathered this pearl of speech
from the lips of one of the hatless young gentlemen
who talked of "Ops," turned his steady and
inscrutable gaze upon Emily, beneath which that
damsel's fetching frown faded, as it always did,
into an uneasy smirk.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is something about that child," she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
once confided to Cook, "that makes me feel as
weak as water. Looks at you as though your 'air
was coming down on your face smudged. Says
nothink, but he's a masterful one. Be a terror
some day!"</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Pipette, in whose charitable little
soul a new and splendid scheme of outdoor relief
had just sprung into being, asked, in a tone of
suppressed excitement&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Pipes, <i>please</i>, does your Terriphone go
straight to our house?"</p>

<p class="indent">"As straight as straight, me lady," replied Mr.
Pipes, who affected an easy jocularity when conversing
with Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ooh!" Pipette turned to her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, amind me to tell you somethin' when
we get home."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip turned a cold glance upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll tell me all about it on the way there,
I expect."</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>won't</i>!" cried Pipette indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes, you will. Women can't keep nothin'
to theirselves."</p>

<p class="indent">This pronouncement, delivered in Mr. Evans's
most impressive manner, roused Emily and Mr.
Pipes to unseemly mirth, and nearly reduced
Pipette to tears. Mr. Pipes remarked that Pip
was a "caution," while Emily summed him up
as a "cure." Shortly after that, Emily and Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
Pipes having made a now familiar reference to
"the same old spot at half-past four on Sunday,"
the visit terminated with the usual expressions of
good-will, and the children were taken home to
tea.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette's offended dignity held out till next
morning, when, as soon as the banging of the
front door announced that Father had gone off
in his brougham for his daily round, she proposed
a visit to the Consulting Room.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the morning? What for?" said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette was positively heaving with suppressed
excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">"You go there and wait," she said, "and I'll
run down to Cook a minute, and then we'll&mdash;no,
I <i>won't</i> tell you yet! Go on!"</p>

<p class="indent">Fearful of letting her precious secret escape
too soon, she gave Pip a push in the direction of
the Consulting Room and danced off to the
kitchen, leaving that impassive philosopher to
ruminate upon the volatile temperament of the
female sex. However, he departed as bidden, and
amused himself by sitting in the swing-chair, and
endeavouring without success, for the hundredth
time, to play a tune on a stethoscope.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Pipette returned, carrying two little
basins of the soup which usually served to span
the yawning gulf between their breakfast and
dinner.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Pip took his soup, and began to drink it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Stop a minute, Pip!" screamed Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip put down his basin.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what is it now?" he remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette at last unfolded her plan.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip," she began a little shyly,&mdash;like all inventors,
she dreaded criticism,&mdash;"you 'member
poor Mr. Pipes saying how cold he was?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, let's send him this nice hot soup, Pip,&mdash;by
Terriphone!"</p>

<p class="indent">The last words came with a rush. Then
Pipette, heaving such a sigh as Sinbad must have
emitted when he had got rid of the Old Man of
the Sea, awaited her brother's reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Silly kid!" he remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette had expected this.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," she said; "but, Pip, wouldn't it be
<i>loverly</i> to do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's practical mind began to evolve difficulties.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>How</i> are you goin' to do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette projected upon him a glance in which
artless surprise, deferential admiration, and simple
faith were exquisitely mingled,&mdash;a glance
which, in after years, her husband once ruefully
described as "good for a ten-pound note at any
hour of the day,"&mdash;and replied simply&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
"I thought <i>you</i> would manage all that, Pip.
You're so bewwy clever!"</p>

<p class="indent">"All right," said Pip. "Let's do it."</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it is that women make fools of the
strongest men.</p>

<p class="indent">They carried their soup carefully over to the
little table beside the telephone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say," said Pip suddenly, "is he to have
both basins?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette's bounteous nature would gladly have
sacrificed both Pip's lunch and her own, but she
thought it wiser to concede this point.</p>

<p class="indent">"No; one will do, I fink," she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right. You can drink half mine," said
Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">They gravely drank Pip's soup, turn about,
and then applied themselves to the matter in
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">First, they lifted the receiver of the telephone
from its rest and surveyed it doubtfully. There
was a cup-shaped receptacle at one end into
which soup could easily be poured, but the
"tube" which connected it to the instrument
was of very meagre dimensions.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you sure there's a pipe all the way?"
inquired Pip doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Certain. It's just the same as the Talking-Hole,
only thinner. And the Talking-Hole has
got a pipe all the way, 'cause don't you remember
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
you put a glass marble in one day when I told
you not to, and it fell out in the hall?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's doubts were not quite satisfied even with
this brilliant parallel.</p>

<p class="indent">"It'll take a long time to get through," he
said. He was fingering the silk-coated wire.
"This pipe's awful thin. A marble would never
get down <i>it</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, but the soup will twickle down all right,"
said Pipette, whose mind, busy with works of
mercy, soared far above these utilitarian details.
(In later years she was a confirmed bazaar
organiser.)</p>

<p class="indent">"We'll ring and tell him first, shall we?"
suggested Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, let's!" murmured Pipette joyfully.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned the call-handle, and Pip held the
receiver, just as he had seen Mr. Evans do. After
a decent interval he remarked into the cup&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you there, Mr. Pipes? This is us."</p>

<p class="indent">This highly illuminating statement met with
no response.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose he can hear you," said Pipette
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes. I'm talkin' just as loud as Mr.
Evans does."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose you'll be able to hear him, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I expect so. But it's a long way. Ring again."</p>

<p class="indent">This time, in turning the call-handle, Pipette
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
accidentally placed her hand on the receiver-hook,
with the result that she actually rang up
the Exchange Office.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently a voice inquired brusquely of Pip
what he wanted. His reply was a delighted yell,
and an announcement to Mr. Pipes that he had
something for him. Further revelations were
frustrated by Pipette, who tore the receiver from
his grasp, and, holding her hand over the opening
to prevent eavesdropping on the part of the
<i>b√©n√©ficiaire</i>, whispered excitedly in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't tell him any more! We'll just pour
it in now, and give him such a surprise!"</p>

<p class="indent">Consequently the young lady in the Exchange
Office was soon compelled to relinquish her
languid efforts to find out what No. 015273
really wanted, and incontinently switched him
off, recking little of the way in which two small
philanthropists at the other end of the wire
were treating the property of the National
Telephone Company.</p>

<p class="indent">Very carefully Pip poured the soup into the
cup-shaped receiver of the telephone, which
Pipette held as steadily as her excitement would
permit.</p>

<p class="indent">From the first it became obvious that soup-delivery
by telephone was going to be a slow
business, for the cup transmitted the generous
fluid most reluctantly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
"It's such a <i>very</i> thin pipe," they explained
to each other hopefully.</p>

<p class="indent">At length Pip remarked&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I should think some of it had got there by
now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not bewwy much, I don't fink," said Pipette;
"this handle thing's still pretty full."</p>

<p class="indent">"But the basin's nearly empty," said Pip.
"The stuff must have gone somewhere."</p>

<p class="indent">"Some of it has gone on the floor," said Pipette
truthfully.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the clock struck one.</p>

<p class="indent">"Father will be in soon," said Pip. "We'd
better wipe up."</p>

<p class="indent">They propped the telephone receiver on the
little table between the directory and a bookstand,
and cleared up the mess on the floor with
a handkerchief&mdash;Pipette's. As they finished
they heard the brougham drive up.</p>

<p class="indent">"It isn't nearly all gone," said Pip gloomily,
peering into the receiver. "If we hang it up on
its hook the stuff will all fall out. Let's leave it
like it is. Father doesn't never use the Terriphone
till after lunch, and it will be all gone by
then. Come on, Pipette."</p>

<p class="indent">The two Samaritans turned their backs upon
the telephone and stole out of the room, leaving
that sorely tried instrument to digest its unaccustomed
luncheon as best it might.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
It was Mr. Evans who suffered most. He was
sent into the Consulting Room just before dinner
to telephone a message to a patient. The telephone
stood in a dark corner, and the gas in the
room was turned low. Mr. Evans was surprised
to find that the receiver, instead of hanging on
its hook, was lying on the little table, carefully
propped between the directory and a bookstand.</p>

<p class="indent">On lifting it up he was surprised by an unwonted
feeling of stickiness; but when he held
the instrument to the light, the reason revealed
itself to him immediately in the form of a dollop
of congealed chicken-broth, nicely rounded to the
shape of the cup, which shot from its resting-place,
with a clammy thud, on to his clean shirtfront,
and then proceeded to slide rapidly down
inside his dress waistcoat, leaving a snail-like
track, dotted with grains of rice, behind it.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was sent supperless to bed, where Pipette,
completely broken down by remorse and sisterly
affection, voluntarily joined him not much later.
The following week they were sent to school.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_2" id="CHAPTER_2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>MR. POCKLINGTON'S</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">So</span> Pip and Pipette went to school, and life in
its entirety lay at their feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Hitherto the social circle in which they moved
had been limited on the male side to Father, Mr.
Evans, and Mr. Pipes, together with the milkman,
the lamplighter, and a few more nodding
acquaintances; and on the female to Tattie
Fowler, Cook, and a long line of housemaids.
The children could neither read nor write; the
fact that they possessed immortal souls was
practically unrevealed to them; and their religious
exercises were limited to a single stereotyped
prayer, imparted by Cook, and perfunctorily
delivered night and morning by the
children, at the bidding of the housemaid in
charge, to a mysterious Power whose sole function,
so far as they could gather, was to keep an
eye upon them during their attendant's frequent
nights-out, and to report delinquencies (by some
occult means) on her return.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the ordinary usages of polite society they
knew little or nothing. To Pip and Pipette
etiquette and deportment were summed up in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the following nursery laws, as amended by the
Kitchen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent">I. Girls, owing to some mysterious infirmity which
is never apparent, and for which they are not responsible,
must be helped first to everything.</p>

<p class="indent">II. A boy must on no account punch a girl, even
though she is older and bigger than himself. (For
reason, see I.)</p>

<p class="indent">III. A girl must not scratch a boy. Not that the
boy matters, but it is unladylike.</p>

<p class="indent">IV. Real men do not play with dolls. (However,
you may pretend to be a doctor, and administer
medicine, without loss of dignity.)</p>

<p class="indent">V. Real ladies do not climb the trees in the garden
in the Square. (But you can get over this difficulty
by pretending to be a boy or a monkey for half an
hour.)</p>

<p class="indent">VI. Girls never have dirty hands&mdash;only boys.
(For solution of this difficulty see note on V.)</p>

<p class="indent">VII. You must <i>never</i> tell tales. Girls must be
specially careful about this, not because they are
more prone to do so, but because boys think they
are.</p>

<p class="indent">VIII. Real men never kiss girls, but they may
sometimes permit girls to kiss them.</p>

<p class="indent">IX. You must eat up your bread-and-butter before
you have any cake. (This rule holds good, they found
out later, all through life.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
X. Do not blow upon your tea to cool it: this is
very vulgar. Pour it into your saucer instead.</p></div>

<p class="indent">Clearly it was high time they went to school,
and Father, who had had vague thoughts for
some time about "procuring a tutor" for Pip,
finally made up his mind, and despatched both
children one morning in the brougham to Mr.
Pocklington's.</p>

<p class="indent">The school was a comfortable-looking building,
standing inside high walls in a secluded corner of
Regent's Park. On the gate shone a large brass
plate bearing the inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">
WENTWORTH HOUSE SCHOOL<br />
AND<br />
KINDERGARTEN.</p>

<p class="margin-left">
<span class="smcap">Mr.</span> POCKLINGTON.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Misses</span> POCKLINGTON.
</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The children could not read this, but Mr.
Evans, who accompanied them in the brougham
on the first morning, kindly consented to do so,
his efforts to pronounce the word "Kindergarten"
(an enterprise upon which he embarked
before realising that he might with perfect safety
have left it out altogether) pleasantly beguiling
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
the time until the gate was opened by a boy in
buttons.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip and Pipette found themselves in a cheerful-looking
hall, larger and brighter than that at
home, and stood staring with solemn eyes at the
unwonted objects around them. From a room
on their right came a subdued hum, and upstairs
they could hear juvenile voices singing in chorus.
They were put to wait in a small room.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the door opened, and an old gentleman
with white whiskers and a black velveteen
jacket trotted in. Mr. Evans bowed respectfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"The doctor's compliments, sir, and I was to
inquire what time the young lady and gentleman
was to be sent for?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Our morning hours," replied Mr. Pocklington
with a precise air, "are from nine-thirty till
twelve-thirty. At twelve-thirty we take exercise
in the playground. Should the weather be
inclement we adjourn to the Gymnasium.
Luncheon is served at one-thirty, and we resume
our studies at two-thirty. We desist from our
labours at four."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Evans having made a dignified exit, the
children, for the first time in their lives, found
themselves alone in the world, and suddenly
realised that the world was very big and they
were very small. Pipette was at once handed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
over to a lady called Miss Arabella, while Pip
was escorted by Mr. Pocklington to the changing-room,
where he was given a peg for his coat,
a peg for his cap, a locker for his boots, and a
wash-hand basin for his ablutions (everything
carefully labelled and numbered), and was otherwise
universally equipped for the battle of life.
Then he was taken into Mr. Pocklington's private
sitting-room, whence, after a brief but all too
adequate inquiry into his attainments, he was
unhesitatingly relegated to the lowest class in the
school, where he found Pipette already installed
at the bottom of the bottom bench. Here we will
leave them for a time, dumbly gazing at the
opening page of a new reading-book, whereon
appears the presentment of what they have
hitherto regarded as a donkey, but which three
large printed letters at the foot of the page inform
them must henceforth be called an A-S-S.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Pocklington had been intended by nature
for an old maid. He was an elderly faddist of a
rather tiresome type, with theories upon every
possible subject, from cellular underclothing to
the higher education of women. He was a
widower, and was assisted in the management
of the school by his three daughters&mdash;Miss
Mary, Miss Arabella, and Miss Amelia.</p>

<p class="indent">The daily routine of Wentworth House School
was marked by an Old-World precision and formality
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
which adults might have found a trifle
irksome; but it did the children no particular
harm beyond making them slightly priggish in
their manners, and no particular good beyond
instilling into them a few habits of order and
method.</p>

<p class="indent">The day began at twenty minutes past nine
with "whistle-in." The "monitor" for the week&mdash;a
patriarch of ten or eleven&mdash;appeared at
the side door, which gave on to the playground,
and blew a resonant blast on a silver whistle.
Followed a scramble in the dressing-rooms, while
boys and girls changed their boots for slippers.
At three minutes to the half-hour the monitor,
having hung the whistle on its proper peg and
armed him-(or her-) self with a dinner-bell,
clanged out a summons to "line up." Thereupon
the pupils of Wentworth House School formed
a double <i>queue</i> along the passage, the eldest boy
with the eldest girl, and so on,&mdash;Mr. Pocklington
believed in mingling the sexes thoroughly: it
taught girls not to whisper and giggle, and gave
boys ease of manner in the presence of females,&mdash;and
at the stroke of nine-thirty, to the accompaniment
of an ear-splitting fantasia on the bell,
the animals marched arm-in-arm into the ark (as
represented by the large schoolroom), where
Noah (Mr. Pocklington), supported by Shem,
Ham, and Japheth (Amazonian Miss Mary, shy
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
and retiring Miss Arabella, and pretty and
frivolous Miss Amelia) stood ready to take roll-call.</p>

<p class="indent">Roll-call at Wentworth House was an all-embracing
function. Besides answering their
names, pupils were required to state whether
they required "lunch" at the interval, and to
announce the name of any library books that
they might be borrowing or returning. Parental
petitions and ultimatums were also delivered at
this time. As might have been expected in such
an establishment, all communications had to be
couched in elegant and suitable phraseology of
Mr. Pocklington's own composition. Consequently
roll-call was a somewhat protracted
function. As a rule the performance consisted of
a series of conversations of the following type:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent"><i>Mr. Pocklington.</i> Reginald!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A high squeaky Voice.</i> Present, sir. I wish to take
a glass of milk during the interval, and I am returning
"The Young Carthaginian," thanking you for the
loan-of-the-same.</p></div>

<p class="indent">Or&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent"><i>Mr. Pocklington.</i> Beatrice!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A rather breathless little Voice.</i> Present, sir. I wish
to take a glass of milk <i>and</i> a bun [<i>very emphatic this</i>]
durin' the interval, and I propose, with your permission,
to borrow this copy of "Carrots Just a Little
Boy"; and, please, I've got a note from mum&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
mean I am the bearer of a letter from my mother asking
for you to be so kind as to&mdash;to excuse my not
havin' done all my home work, 'cos I forgot&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Pocklington.</i> Beatrice!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The R. B. L. V.</i> I mean 'cos I <i>neglected</i> [there was
no such word as "forget" in Mr. Pocklington's curriculum]
to take the book home. And, please, mum&mdash;my
mother would have written to you by post last
night, only she forg&mdash;neglected to do it till it was
too late.</p></div>

<p class="indent">And Beatrice, having unburdened herself of
a task which has been clouding her small horizon
ever since breakfast, sits down with a sigh of
intense relief.</p>

<p class="indent">On the first morning after their arrival, Mr.
Pocklington, having called out the last name and
registered the last glass of milk, drew the attention
of the school to Pip and Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">"You have to welcome two fresh companions
this morning," he said. "I will enter their
names on the register, and will then read them
aloud to you, in order that you may know how
to address your new friends."</p>

<p class="indent">Turning to Pip, Mr. Pocklington asked his
name.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no," said Mr. Pocklington testily. "Your
first baptismal name, boy!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, to whom the existence of baptismal names
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
was now revealed for the first time, merely
turned extremely red and shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">"We do not countenance childish nicknames
here," said Mr. Pocklington grandly. "What is
your Christian name, boy?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, to whom Christian and baptismal names
were an equal mystery, continued to sit mute,
glaring the while in a most disconcerting fashion
at poor Miss Arabella, who happened to sit opposite
to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Pocklington turned impatiently to Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is your brother's name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, it's just Pip," replied Pipette plaintively,
groping for Pip's hand under the desk.
"He hasn't got any other name, I don't fink."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps it is Philip," suggested pretty Miss
Amelia. "I believe"&mdash;with a little blush&mdash;"that
'Pip' is occasionally used as an abbreviation
for that name. Is your name Philip, little
boy?" she asked, leaning forward to Pip, with a
glance which he would have valued considerably
more if he had been ten years older.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think it must be Philip," said Miss Amelia,
turning to her father.</p>

<p class="indent">So Pip was inscribed on the roll as Philip,
which, as it happened, <i>was</i> his real name. (By
the way, his surname was Wilmot.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, <i>your</i> first baptismal name, little girl?"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
said Mr. Pocklington briskly, turning to Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, it's Pipette," she replied apprehensively.</p>

<p class="indent">Her fears were not ungrounded. The school
began to titter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pipette? My dear, that is a quite impossible
name. A pipette is a small glass instrument employed
in practical chemistry. Surely you have
some proper baptismal name! Perhaps you can
suggest a solution again," he added, turning to
Miss Amelia.</p>

<p class="indent">No, Miss Amelia could offer no suggestion.
Her forte, it appeared, was gentlemen's names.
As a matter of fact, Pipette's name, as ascertained
by reference to Father by post that
night, was Dorothea, and she had been laughingly
christened "Pipette" by her mother, because
her father, when summoned from the
laboratory to view his newly born daughter,
had arrived holding a pipette in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">So Pip and Pipette, much to their surprise and
indignation, found themselves addressed as Philip
and Dorothea respectively, and as such joined in
the pursuit of knowledge in company with a motley
crew of Arthurs, Reginalds, Ermyntrudes,
Winifreds, and the like. Surnames were not employed
in the school. If two children possessed
the same Christian name they were distinguished
by the addition of any other sub-title they happened
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
to possess. Three unfortunate youths, for
instance, were addressed respectively as John
Augustus, John William, and John Evelyn.</p>

<p class="indent">Things at Wentworth House School move in
a stereotyped circle, and Pip and Pipette soon
became familiar with the curriculum. There were
three classes, they found. The First Class, the
veterans, nearly old enough to go to a preparatory
school, dwelt in a stuffy apartment called "The
Study." Their learning was profound, for they were
taught a mysterious language called Latin, and another,
even more mysterious, called "Alzeber" (or
something like that). The Second Class, conducted
by Miss Mary&mdash;formidable, but a good
sort&mdash;in a corner of the schoolroom, did not fly
so high. They studied history and geography,
and were addicted to a fearsome form of parlour-game
called "Mentalarithmetic," which involved
much shrieking of answers to highly impossible
questions about equally dividing seventeen apples
among five boys.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip and Pipette occupied a humble position in
the Third Class, where they soon developed a
fervent admiration for pretty Miss Amelia, who
was always smiling, always daintily dressed, and
charmingly inaccurate and casual.</p>

<p class="indent">On Thursday afternoons the whole school assembled
in the Music Room. Here faded Miss
Arabella thumped mechanically on the piano,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
while the pupils of Wentworth House School
chanted an inexplicable and interminable ditty
entitled "Doh-ray-me-fah." The words of this
canticle were printed on a canvas sheet upon
the wall, and the method of inculcation was
somewhat peculiar. Mr. Pocklington, taking his
stand beside the sheet, would lay the tip of
his little white wand upon the word "Doh"
printed at the bottom. Miss Arabella would
strike a note upon the piano, and the school
would reproduce the same with no uncertain
sound, sustaining it by one prolonged howl until
the white wand slid up to "Ray," an example
which the vocalists would attempt to follow to
the best of their ability, and with varying degrees
of success. Having rallied and concentrated
his forces on "Ray," Mr. Pocklington
would advance to "Me," and then to "Fah," the
effects achieved by the elder male choristers,
whose voices were reaching the cracking stage,
as the scale approached the topmost "Doh,"
being as surprising as they were various.</p>

<p class="indent">The hour always concluded with a sort of
musical steeplechase. The white wand would
skip incontinently from Doh to Fah, and from
Me to Soh, the singers following after&mdash;faint
yet pursuing. At the end of three minutes, the
field having tailed out, so to speak, every note
in the gamut was being sung, <i>fortissimo</i>, by at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
least one member of the choir, and the total
effect was more suggestive of a home for lost
dogs than an academy for the sons and daughters
of gentlemen.</p>

<p class="indent">Our friends enjoyed this diversion hugely.
Pipette, who could carol like a lark, hopped
from note to note with an agility only equalled
by that of the white wand itself. Pip, who had
no music in his soul, adopted a different method
of procedure. Selecting a note well within his
compass, he would stick to it with characteristic
thoroughness and a gradually blackening countenance,
until a final flourish from the white
wand intimated to all and sundry that this
nuisance must now cease.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip and Pipette were also submitted to a
rather farcical ordeal which Mr. Pocklington
called his "common-sense test." Shortly after
their arrival they were called into the Study,
where Mr. Pocklington, after a little homily on
the danger of judging by appearances and the
fallaciousness of giving preference to quantity
rather than quality, produced a threepenny-bit
and a penny, and commanded his auditors to
take their choice. Pipette unhesitatingly picked
the threepenny-bit, and was commended for her
acumen. Pip, when it came to his turn, selected
the penny, and after being soundly rated for
his stupidity was cast forth from the Study and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
bidden to learn sense. A week later he was
again put to the test, and again chose the
penny, repeating his performance with stolid
regularity when given a further opportunity of
redeeming his character the following week.
After that the affair developed into a kind of
round game, Mr. Pocklington producing the two
coins from time to time and Pip invariably selecting
the penny,&mdash;a proceeding which gave his
preceptor unlimited opportunities for tiresome
little lectures to the school in general, and Pip
in particular, on the subjects mentioned above.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, after the entertainment had been
repeated week by week for some time, Pipette,
whose loyal little soul chafed at the sycophantic
giggles of the other boys and girls when Pip
was being scarified by Mr. Pocklington, boldly
broached the matter to her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, why don't you take the fripenny-bit?
If you did he'd stop bein' so howwid to you."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip regarded his sister's small eager face with
cold scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">"If once I took the threepenny-bit," he replied,
"he'd stop offerin' the money altogether.
Why, I've made eightpence since I came here.
Silly kid!"</p>

<p class="indent">This was the last occasion in their lives on
which Pipette ever questioned the wisdom of
her beloved brother's actions.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Both children made friends rapidly. Pip,
indeed, soon after his arrival, received a proposal
of marriage, which, ever ready to oblige a lady,
he accepted forthwith. But he was reckoning
without Pipette. That jealous little person, finding
one day that Pip had suddenly deserted her,
and was at that moment actually sharing his
morning bun with his fianc√©e in the boot-room,
incontinently burst in upon the lovers, and after
a brief but decisive interview despatched her
rival howling from the room, remaining herself
to share the bun with the newly restored Pip,
who, to be quite frank, had been finding the r√¥le
of a Romeo, however passive, rather exacting.</p>

<p class="indent">Isabel Dinting, the disappointed lady, was
inconsolable for a day or two, but she eventually
recovered her spirits, and lived to heap coals of
fire on Pip's head, as you shall hear.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the most curious and characteristic
institutions at Wentworth House School was
Mr. Pocklington's system of "Task-Tickets."
Every boy and girl on entering the school received
ten little tablets about the size of visiting-cards,
inscribed with his or her name, and numbered
from one to ten consecutively. If a pupil
failed in a lesson or broke a rule, one of his Task-Tickets
was impounded, and was not restored
until the faulty lesson was perfected or a specified
imposition performed. Periodically there would
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
be an "inspection," and many a small head
whose owner was discovered to be short of
tickets would be hung in shame that day. Only
such confirmed reprobates as Thomas Oates, the
bad boy of the school (whom Mr. Pocklington
in his more jocular moments addressed as "Titus,"
much to his hearers' mystification), could
endure the stigma of being perpetually without a
full complement. Thomas indeed once electrified
the school by announcing to Miss Mary, when
asked for a ticket in default of an unlearned lesson,
that <i>all</i> his tickets were in pawn already, and
that, until he had redeemed one of the same, he
would be unable to oblige her. Mr. Pocklington
and the majority of his staff were horror-struck
at such iniquity; but Miss Mary, in whom was
concentrated most of the common sense of the
family, instituted a search in Master Thomas's
desk, with the result that she triumphantly
fished out no less than five tickets. All of which
goes to prove that Thomas Oates, like a good
many of us, preferred notoriety, even as a malefactor,
to respectable oblivion.</p>

<p class="indent">The Task-Ticket system presented another
feature of interest. Besides their regulation ten
ordinary tickets, Mr. Pocklington's pupils were
entitled to acquire "Special Task-Tickets." If
you weeded the garden, or filled some ink-pots,
or wrote a specially neat copy, you were presented
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
with a Task-Ticket marked "Special" in
red ink in one corner. Next time a breakdown
in work or the infraction of a rule brought you
within the sphere of operations of Mr. Pocklington's
penal code, exemption from punishment
could be purchased by payment of one or more
of your Special Task-Tickets. This scheme was
attractive in several ways. Good children&mdash;chiefly
little girls, it must be admitted&mdash;accumulated
these treasures assiduously for the mere
joy of possession, the trifling fact that their
owners were far too virtuous to be likely ever to
have need of them being more than counterbalanced
by the comfortable glow of satisfaction
with which the existence of such a moral bank-balance
suffused their rather self-righteous little
bosoms. Wicked children, on the other hand,
would laboriously collect tickets against a rainy
day, and, having accumulated a sufficient store
to pay for the consequences, would indulge in a
prolonged orgy of sin until the last ticket was
gone. Thomas Oates once found ten Special
Task-Tickets in an old desk, and having straightway
filled a like number of buttoned boots in the
girls' dressing-room with soap-and-water, proffered
the same in compensation. However, the
possession of so much hoarded virtue in such a
proclaimed reprobate roused the suspicions of
the authorities. Inquiries were set on foot, the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
fraud was discovered, and Thomas was only
saved from expulsion from Wentworth House
School by the intercession of pretty Miss Amelia,
who cherished a weakness for all renegades of the
opposite sex.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's tear-stained ex-fianc√©e, Isabel Dinting,
anxious to drive away the depression resultant
upon her unfortunate attachment, allowed herself
to become badly bitten with the ticket-collecting
mania. Her own ten ordinary tickets invariably
presented a full muster, and all her soul was set
upon the acquisition of Specials. These, by
the way, were transferable, and consequently
Isabel's friends were requested to bestir themselves,
and by extra acts of virtue earn something
to contribute to her store. Pip himself
assisted her. One day he caught and expelled
from the classroom a troublesome bumblebee,
and, much to his surprise, was awarded a
Special Task-Ticket by the grateful Miss Amelia.
He promptly handed over the gift to Isabel,
whose gratification knew no bounds. Touched
by his adorer's thanks, Pip decided in his quiet
way to help her further. Next morning the
schoolroom suffered from a positive inundation
of bumblebees, and the services rendered by Pip
in removing them were rewarded by more
Specials, all of which were duly handed over to
the now greatly consoled Isabel. When, however,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
the phenomenon occurred again on the following
morning, Miss Mary, who did not share her sister's
romantic belief in the integrity of the male
sex, became suspicious, and insisted on searching
Pip's desk. An incautiously handled paper bag
emitted a perfect cascade of moribund bumblebees,
and Pip's ingenious device for obliging a
lady stood revealed. After that he made no more
contributions to the supply.</p>

<p class="indent">Mention has already been made of that arch-ruffian
Master Thomas Oates. With him Pip
waged war from the day that he entered the
school. Hostilities commenced immediately.
Thomas dared Pip to place his hand in a can
of almost boiling water in the dressing-room.
Pip did so, and kept it there unwinkingly for
the space of a full minute. Next day his hand
was skinless, and Father had to dress it for him
in splendidly conspicuous bandages. Pip retaliated
by initiating a breath-holding contest, in
which his opponent was not only worsted, but
admitted his defeat by an involuntary and sonorous
gurgle right in the middle of one of Mr. Pocklington's
customary harangues on nothing in
particular in the large schoolroom. He was
promptly scarified for his unseemly conduct and
fined three Task-Tickets.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon, to the curiosity of all and the
trepidation of some, "Whistle-in" sounded at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
two-fifteen instead of two-twenty-five. Evidently
something momentous was about to
occur.</p>

<p class="indent">All his pupils being seated, and the roll having
been called, Mr. Pocklington, with an air of
portentous solemnity, explained the reason for
which they were assembled and met together.
It was nothing very dreadful after all, but the
seriousness with which the subject was treated
by their preceptor impressed the children with a
hazy feeling that they were assisting at a murder
trial.</p>

<p class="indent">Some person or persons unknown, it appeared,
had invaded the Study, and had embellished
the features of a bust of Julius C√¶sar, which
stood on the mantelpiece, with some assorted
coloured chalks, which further investigation
proved to have been stolen from the chalk-box
by the blackboard. Mr. Pocklington, who
was not blessed with a sense of humour, sought
to drive home the enormity of this offence by
ocular demonstration. He rang the bell; and
after a short but impressive pause the door of
the schoolroom was thrown open by the pageboy,
and the butler staggered majestically in,
carrying Julius C√¶sar on a tea-tray. That
empire-builder's "make-up" could hardly be called
a becoming one. A red nose gave him a bibulous
appearance, his blue chin suggested late rising
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
and the absence of a razor, and a highly unsymmetrical
moustache, executed in mauve chalk,
stood out in vivid contrast to his blackened right
eye. It says much for the impression which Mr.
Pocklington's introductory harangue had
produced that not a child in the room so much as
smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">The perspiring butler having set down his
alcoholic-looking burden upon a small table and
withdrawn, attended by his satellite,&mdash;the only
person present, by the way, who appeared inclined
to regard the situation with levity,&mdash;Mr.
Pocklington once more addressed his cowering
audience.</p>

<p class="indent">"I will now ask the perpetrator of this outrage,"
he thundered, "to stand up, that I may
punish him as he deserves."</p>

<p class="indent">The little girls all shivered with apprehension,
but one or two little boys looked slightly amused.
They were not very old or experienced, but they
were not green enough to join gratuitously in a
game of "Dilly, Dilly, come and be killed!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Pocklington played his next card.</p>

<p class="indent">"I may add," he continued, "that a boy was
seen to leave the Study in a surreptitious manner
shortly after this offence must have been committed.
No one has entered the Study since.
That boy, therefore, must be the culprit. If he
does not immediately respond to the dictates of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
his conscience and stand up in his place&mdash;I shall
expose him! Now, please!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a death-like silence, suddenly
broken by piercing shrieks from one Gwendoline
Harvey, aged seven, for whose infant nerves the
strain had proved too great.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, it wasn't me," she wailed, "and&mdash;and&mdash;and
I've lost my hankey!"</p>

<p class="indent">Tender-hearted Miss Arabella supplied the
deficiency, and led her out, still sobbing. The
inquisition was resumed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall give the culprit one more minute,"
announced Mr. Pocklington in the tones of a
Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p class="indent">There was another tense silence. The inmates
of Wentworth House School breathed hard,
looked straight before them, and waited with
their small mouths wide open. One or two little
girls&mdash;and small boys, for that matter&mdash;gripped
the benches convulsively, and with difficulty
refrained from screaming.</p>

<p class="indent">"The minute has elapsed," proclaimed the
Grand Inquisitor. "Philip, stand up!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" A long, shuddering sigh, partly of
relief and partly of apprehension, ran round the
room. Pipette turned deathly pale. Pip rose
slowly to his feet, staring intently in his disconcerting
way at the besotted features of Julius
C√¶sar.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
"Philip," said Mr. Pocklington, "you were
seen coming out of the Study at one-twenty.
What have you to say?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip had nothing to say, but transferred his
gaze to Mr. Pocklington. As a matter of fact he
had not entered the Study. He had spent some
time, it was true, in the passage outside the door,
but that was because he was waiting for Thomas
Oates, having arranged to meet him there for five
minutes, for the purpose of adjusting a small difference
on a matter of a purely personal character,
calling for plenty of elbow-room and freedom
from publicity. Tommy Oates had not appeared,
and Pip had been late for luncheon in consequence.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you confess to this outrage?" inquired
Mr. Pocklington, coming suddenly to the point.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip collected himself. Then as common politeness
seemed to demand some sort of reply, he
said, "No."</p>

<p class="indent">Another slight shudder passed round the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know anything about the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was about to reply with another negative,
when it suddenly flashed across his mind that
as he stood outside the Study waiting for Master
Oates he had experienced considerable difficulty
in getting rid of Isabel Dinting, who had hovered
around him in a highly flattering but most embarrassing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
fashion just when he wished to compose
and concentrate his faculties for his coming
interview with Tommy. What was she doing
there? What could her business have been?
In plain truth she had come to avert a possible
battle between Pip and Tommy, but this never
occurred to Pip: he had not thought it possible
that any one should take such a close interest
in his movements. Anyhow this was no concern
of his. Accordingly he said, "No" a second time.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came another question.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you deny having been in the Study?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"But you were seen coming from the passage
leading to the Study door."</p>

<p class="indent">No answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you admit that you were in that passage?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes." (Sensation.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Philip," said Mr. Pocklington, "that passage
leads only to the Study. What other motive
can have taken you there?"</p>

<p class="indent">No answer. It is difficult on the spur of the
moment to frame a plausible excuse for having
in cold blood arranged a sanguinary encounter
outside your Principal's study door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you decline to answer?"</p>

<p class="indent">Again no reply from Pip. Another pause. Mr.
Pocklington, now as excited as a terrier halfway
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
down a rabbit-hole, with difficulty refrained
from pronouncing sentence on the spot. However,
he restrained himself so far as to remember
to sum up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Appearances are against you, Philip," he
began. "You were seen leaving the&mdash;the scene
of the outrage in a suspicious manner shortly
after that outrage was committed. You decline
to state what business took you there. No one
else visited the spot during the time under consideration&mdash;at
least&mdash;by the way, <i>did</i> you see
any one else while you&mdash;during that period?"</p>

<p class="indent">This chance shot hit Pip hard. That Isabel
Dinting should have painted Julius C√¶sar's nose
red seemed almost beyond the bounds of human
probability. Still she undoubtedly <i>had</i> been
there, and with Mr. Pocklington in his present
state the sudden revelation of such a fact would
probably cause a perfect eruption. Pip hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Was any one else there?" reiterated Mr.
Pocklington.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was essentially a truthful boy, and the
idea of saying, "No" never occurred to him.
Accordingly he said nothing, as before.</p>

<p class="indent">The eruption immediately took place.</p>

<p class="indent">"Philip," thundered Mr. Pocklington, "I have
asked you two questions. You have answered
neither of them. Do you decline to do so?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
A very long pause this time. Then&mdash;"Yes,"
said Pip briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">"In that case," replied Mr. Pocklington, metaphorically
assuming the black cap, "I must pronounce
you guilty. Still, I would rather you
confessed than were convicted. I will give you
one more minute."</p>

<p class="indent">Sixty palpitating seconds passed. Forty juvenile
hearts bumped tumultuously, and Pip still
stood up, a very straight, very silent, and not
undignified little figure.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you anything further to say?" inquired
Mr. Pocklington at last, now almost convinced
that he was the Lord Chief Justice
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip shook his head. He seldom wasted words.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I pronounce you guilty. You have
committed an offence against decency and good
taste that I have never known paralleled in the
history of this school. Your punishment"&mdash;the
children held their breath&mdash;"must be a matter
for consideration. Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Pocklington paused, and frowned at Isabel
Dinting, who was groping for something in her
desk.</p>

<p class="indent">"Meanwhile," he continued, having suddenly
decided to keep Pip in durance vile until a punishment
could be devised in keeping with his crime,
"you will be incarcerated&mdash;Well, Isabel?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Isabel Dinting was standing up in her place,
with her small countenance flushed and apprehensive,
but bravely waving one hand in the air
to attract attention. In the other she grasped
a rather grubby and bulgy envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, <i>may</i> I speak to Pi&mdash;Philip?" she
gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Pocklington was too surprised to be
pedantic.</p>

<p class="indent">"To Philip? Why, my child?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because&mdash;well, because I've got somefing to
give him."</p>

<p class="indent">"This is hardly the time for an exchange of
gifts," remarked Mr. Pocklington severely.</p>

<p class="indent">"But <i>may</i> I?" persisted Isabel, with a boldness
which surprised herself.</p>

<p class="indent">"I cannot imagine what your gift can be, but
if it has any bearing on the present deplorable
case, I should be only too thankful to permit&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But long before this homily was completed
Isabel had slipped out of her seat and was standing
by Pip's side, whispering excitedly into his
ear and endeavouring to thrust the grubby envelope
into his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take them," she panted. "There's thirty-five
of them. Give him them <i>all</i>, <i>now</i>, and he'll
let you off."</p>

<p class="indent">Poor little Isabel! Surely under all the broad
heavens there was no crime that could not be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
atoned for by the surrender of thirty-five laboriously
acquired Special Task-Tickets!</p>

<p class="indent">Pip smiled at her. He was a plain-looking
little boy, but he possessed an extraordinarily
attractive smile, and Isabel felt utterly, absolutely,
and completely rewarded for her sacrifice.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Mr. Pocklington had come to the
conclusion that all this was highly irregular.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bring me that envelope!" he commanded.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip handed up the envelope. Mr. Pocklington
opened it, and out tumbled the thirty-five Special
Task-Tickets.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is all this?" he inquired testily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Special Task-Tickets," replied Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"To whom do they belong?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Isabel."</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;they belong to Pip!" screamed that
small maiden. "Won't you let him off if he gives
them <i>all</i> to you, please? I've given them to him.
I&mdash;I don't mind losin' them."</p>

<p class="indent">Isabel's voice quavered suddenly; and then,
having conducted her case unflinchingly past the
critical point, she dissolved, woman-like, into
reactionary tears.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence now, broken only by
Isabel's sobs. Pip stood still stiffly at attention,
facing the grinning effigy of Julius C√¶sar. Every
child in the room (except Pipette) was lost in
admiration of Isabel's heroic devotion, for all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
knew how precious was her collection of tickets
to her. Miss Mary smiled genially; Miss Amelia's
eyes filled with sympathetic tears. Even Mr.
Pocklington was touched. Hastily he flung together
in his mind a few sentences appropriate
to the occasion. "Unselfishness"&mdash;"devotion
to a friend"&mdash;"a lesson for all"&mdash;the rounded
phrases formed themselves upon his tongue. He
was ready now.</p>

<p class="indent">"I cannot refrain&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p class="indent">It was true enough, but he got no further; for
above the formal tones of his voice, above the
stifled whispering of the school, and above the
now unrestrained lamentations of Isabel Dinting,
rose the voice of Master Thomas Oates, in a howl
in which remorse, hysteria, and apprehension
were about equally mingled.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was me!" he roared. "Booh&mdash;hoo!"</p>

<p class="indent">His sinful but sentimental soul, already goaded
to excessive discomfort by the promptings of an
officious conscience, had with difficulty endured
the inquisition upon the innocent Pip, and after
Isabel's romantic intervention he could contain
himself no longer. Confession burst spontaneously
from his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was me!" he repeated, <i>fortissimo</i>, knuckling
his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a final astonished gasp from the
school.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
"It was <i>I</i>, Thomas," corrected Mr. Pocklington,
the ruling passion strong even at this crisis.</p>

<p class="indent">"No it wasn't!" roared Thomas, determined
to purge his soul. "It was <i>me</i>! I was in the Study
when Pip was outside, and I did it and got out
when he was talking to Isabel, and&mdash;and I
won't do it again. Aah&mdash;ooh!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Pip became a hero, of course, but bore his
honours with indifference.</p>

<p class="indent">Isabel expostulated with him.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was awful brave of you to say nothin' all
the time," she remarked admiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">"There was nothing to say," replied Pip, with
truth.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you said nothin' when you knew it was
Tommy all the time," persisted Isabel, anxious
to keep her idol on his pedestal.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn't think it was Tommy," said Pip; "I
thought it was you."</p>

<p class="indent">Isabel's round eyes grew positively owl-like.</p>

<p class="indent">"Me? Oh, Pip! How <i>splendid</i> of you!"</p>

<p class="indent">In his lifetime Pip inspired three women with
love for him&mdash;two more than his proper allowance.
Isabel was the first. The others will follow
in due course.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_3" id="CHAPTER_3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>"HAM"</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> schoolmaster realises early in his career
that he is not a universally popular person. If he
keeps his boys in order and compels them to
work, they dislike him heartily; if he allows
them to do as they please they despise him; if
he is cheerful and jocose in his demeanour, they
consider him "a funny ass"; if he is austere and
academic, they call him "a gloomy swine." If
he endeavours, by strong measures, to call sinners
to repentance, he is said to have done so
from personal spite; and if he shows kindness to
the few righteous persons whom he may encounter
in his form, he is accused of favouritism. After
he has been at school a short time he realises
this, and it distresses him.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes he goes so far as to decide that he
has mistaken his vocation, and he resigns and
becomes a school inspector. But presently he
notices that elderly and revered colleagues have
laughed and grown fat under this treatment for
thirty years, and indeed look upon the seething
indignation of their subjects as the salt of life.
This comforts him. He tries again, and presently
discovers that it is possible to be the hated oppressor
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;55]</span>
of his form in public and their familiar
friend and trusted adviser in private. Collective
hostility vanishes under the influence of a cup of
tea or an evening on the river, and individual
friendship takes its place. Last of all as he
grows older, comes that continuous calm which
marks his older colleagues: for he knows now
that Jinks minor and Muggins tertius, who sit in
the back row with lowering brows and grinding
teeth, chafing under his tyranny and preaching
sedition at intervals, will one day come and sit in
his armchairs, with their feet on his mantelpiece,
bearded or sunburned or distinguished, and will
convey to him, if not in words, at any rate by
their demeanour, their heartfelt thanks for the
benefits which he lavished upon them with so
unsparing a hand in the grand old days in the
Shell or the Remove or the Lower Fifth. That
is his reward. Men have died for less.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, Mr. Hanbury, lord and master of the
Lower Shell, a sort of intellectual dust-heap on
the Modern side at Grandwich School, was
specially favoured by the gods in that he received
his reward more quickly than most. He was
twenty-nine; he had been a famous Cricket Blue,
and he enjoyed the respectful admiration of countless
boys, who listened eagerly to his small talk,
felt proud when he spoke to them unofficially,
and endeavoured to imitate his bowling action.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;56]</span>
He also possessed other qualifications. He
loved his work, he took immense pains to understand
each of his boys, and he endeavoured by
daily admonition and occasional castigation to
goad his form into respectability.</p>

<p class="indent">For in truth they were a poor lot. Why
they were called the Shell was a mystery,&mdash;the
Sieve would have described them better.
Large, cumbrous persons, with small heads and
colossal feet, with vacant faces and incipient
beards, stuck in its meshes and remained there
forever, while their more youthful and slippery
brethren wriggled through. Most masters resigned
their posts after a year of the Lower Shell,
with the result that that glorious company were
constantly entrusted to the newest and rawest
recruit on the staff. Consequently discipline
was lax; and when the Head rather apologetically
handed the form over to Mr. Hanbury, it
became instantly apparent that the ultimate
result would be the collapse of Hanbury or the
reformation of the Shell.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter alternative came to pass, but not
before both sides had distinguished themselves
in several engagements.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hanbury had to teach his form self-respect.
Long experience had taught them that
they were incapable as a body of producing good
work; and being constitutionally averse to half-measures,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
they were accustomed, rather than
turn out a second-rate article, to turn out nothing
at all. Like the Tenth, who do not dance,
the Lower Shell did not work.</p>

<p class="indent">They therefore looked upon it as a breach of
academic etiquette when Mr. Hanbury violently
assaulted three of their most distinguished
members, for no other reason than that they,
following the immemorial custom of the form,
omitted for three consecutive evenings to do
any "prep." With ready acumen the Shell also
discovered that their new form-master had no
sense of humour. Else why, when Elphinstone,
commonly known as "Top-knot," let loose a
blackbird from a bandbox during the history
hour, and every one else present was convulsed
with honest mirth, should Mr. Hanbury, with an
absolutely fatuous affectation of solemnity, have
made absurd remarks about teaching small boys
manners, and have laid such violent hands on
Elphinstone as to make it necessary for that
enterprising ornithologist to take his meals from
off the mantelpiece for the next three days?</p>

<p class="indent">Besides being a tyrant and a dullard, their
form-master, they observed, was not even a
gentleman. When Crabbe major, a youth of
determined character and litigious habits, took
the trouble to stay behind and point out to
Mr. Hanbury that by depriving him (Crabbe
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
major) of all his marks for the week for the paltry
indiscretion of cribbing from Jones, Mr. Hanbury
was outraging the most elementary principles
of justice (Jones's involuntary aid being
not worth even an hour's marks), his treatment
of Crabbe was undignified and flippant to the
last degree.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here, my dear young Christian friend,"
he had said, "just cut away to your tea, and
be thankful you are in a condition to sit down
to it."</p>

<p class="indent">Crabbe disregarded the utter grossness of this
innuendo.</p>

<p class="indent">"My people, sir," he remarked, "will not be
pleased if I go home at the end of the term without
any marks."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is that all?" replied Mr. Hanbury. "Step
round to my room before your cab comes and
I'll send you home all over them. Now, hook it,
and don't be a young ass again."</p>

<p class="indent">A reply in the worst possible taste, the form
decided.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hanbury, or "Ham" as he was usually
called, had been in charge of the Lower Shell
some four years, and had long reduced that
chaotic assembly to respectability, and even intelligence.
It was the first morning of a new
term, and he had just entered his classroom,
and was engaged in greeting his pupils. The ceremony
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
over, he mounted his throne and addressed
the multitude,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Having said 'How do you do?' to all of you,
I will now proceed to say 'Good-bye' to some of
you. Hood down to Aitchison, you are promoted.
Out you go! Mr. Mayor is anxious to
make your acquaintance."</p>

<p class="indent">Ten sheepish youths rose up and filed out.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, move up, all of you. We shall have
some recruits in presently. Brown minor, you
have not got your remove, but you are now in the
proud position of head boy of this form. Hallo!
here come our friends from the Lower Regions."</p>

<p class="indent">Eleven far more sheepish youths here entered
the room, headed by a small boy in spectacles,
who made his entrance some way ahead of his
fellows with a suddenness that suggested propulsion
from the rear. All took up a retired position
on the back bench.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, sort yourselves," continued Ham.
"Old guard, close up! Then the promotions,
then the new boys in alphabetical order."</p>

<p class="indent">This arrangement left the form in something
like order. At the head sat Mr. Brown minor;
at the tail a small and alert youth with black
hair, a face freckled like a plover's egg, and
solemn eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The Commander-in-Chief addressed them,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Brown minor, you are unanimously elected
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;60]</span>
first lieutenant. You must remind me to set
preparation every night, and you will write the
same on the board in a fair round hand, that
he who runs for tea may read. You, sir,&mdash;let
me see, Wilmot: thank you" (addressing the
solemn youth at the foot of the form)&mdash;"are
hereby appointed scavenger. Your duties will be
explained to you by Mr. Brown. They relate
chiefly to the tidiness of this room. You have
obtained this important post solely because of
your position in the alphabet. If you had had
the misfortune to be called Atkins or Absalom,
you would have failed to do so. We will now
proceed to the orders of the day."</p>

<p class="indent">And this was Pip's first encounter with one
of his lifelong friends.</p>

<p class="indent">The friendship did not form itself all at once.
For a year they struggled together, Mr. Hanbury
to find something that Pip could learn, Pip
to find something that "Ham" could teach. Pip,
it must be confessed, was no genius, even from
Thomas Carlyle's point of view, and he retained
the post of scavenger for the whole of his first
year in the form. Otherwise, he was well content.
He acquired friends, notably one Mumford,
whose superior position in the alphabet was
his sole qualification for exemption from the post
of scavenger.</p>

<p class="indent">The duties of that official, by the way, were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span>
not arduous. He was expected to open the windows
wide for two minutes between each hour,
to pick up stray ink-pots, and keep the blackboard
clean. There were other duties of an unofficial
nature attached to the post, the chief
of which was to stand with an eye glued to the
keyhole until the master for the hour loomed
upon the horizon, and then to herald his approach
by a cry of "Cave!" whereupon the form
would betake themselves to their seats with an
alacrity which varied inversely with the master's
reputation for indulgence.</p>

<p class="indent">One day Mr. Hanbury thoughtlessly came by
an unexpected route, and was at the door-handle
before Pip realised that he was near. Consequently
Pip was thrown heavily on to his back
with a contused eye; and after listening throughout
the hour to facetious remarks from Ham
about Sister Anne and Horatius Cocles, endured
the further indignity of being kicked by a select
committee of the Lower Shell, who afterwards
deposed him from his high office, and appointed
Mumford in his stead.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's services, however, were speedily requisitioned
again, for Mumford proved but a broken
reed. He was by nature deliberate in his movements,
and the form were more than once taken
by surprise owing to their watchman's remissness
at the keyhole. His last performance, that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
which brought Pip back to office, was of such
an exceptional nature, and took the fancy of
the school to such an extent, that it is to this
day preserved among the unwritten archives of
Grandwich, bracketed equal with the occasion
on which Plumbley minor walked into the French
classroom whistling, with a bandbox containing
a nest of field-mice under his arm, only to discover,
after liberating the mice, that the Head
was sitting in the French master's place.</p>

<p class="indent">Mumford one day stood crouching at his keyhole.
All around him surged the Lower Shell,
busily employed in obliterating the traces of a
brief but sanguinary combat between Jenkins
and MacFarlane. The fight had arisen over
some small matter of an international character,
and after four spirited rounds it was decided
that honours so far were equally divided, and
that the final round had better be postponed
until the interval before dinner. The form accordingly
settled down in their places, and with
a passing admonition to Mumford to persevere
in his vigil, betook themselves to conversation
until Ham should be pleased to put in
an appearance. As that tyrant had not yet
appeared at the far end of the corridor outside,
Mumford decided that this was a good opportunity
for retiring for a brief moment from his
post to his locker, for purposes of refreshment.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
But fortune was against him. Mr. Hanbury had
been out to see the ground-man on some cricket
business, and consequently came up to his classroom
by that abominable "alternative route."
He entered the room quietly, and after walking
to his desk was on the point of reprimanding
Mumford, whose head was buried in his locker,
for being out of his seat, when his words were
arrested by the somewhat eccentric behaviour
of that remarkable youth. Mumford left his
locker, and having thrust a biscuit into his
cheek, walked across the room to the door, where
he bent down and applied his eye to the keyhole.</p>

<p class="indent">The form sat spellbound; and Mr. Hanbury
was too astonished to break the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the infatuated Mumford, having
finished his biscuit, proceeded to describe to his
classmates the movements of the enemy outside.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right!" he remarked cheerfully. "Not in
sight yet&mdash;only Wilkes and Jordan. There's the
Badger now. What cheer, Badger, old man?"
(The Badger was the Senior Science Master.)</p>

<p class="indent">The form gave no sign, though Brown minor
and Pip were exhibiting symptoms of incipient
apoplexy; and Mr. Hanbury came to the conclusion
that this comedy had better cease. But
the luckless Mumford, his eye still firmly adhering
to the keyhole, continued,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo! there's the Head. Hope he meets
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
some of those chaps. Very slack, their not goin'
to their classrooms till five minutes past the
hour. Wonder where Ham is. Downstairs, I expect,
cadging beer off the butler. He'll probably
be tight when he&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">At this point, flattered by the deferential silence
with which his remarks were being received,
and desirous of observing the effect of
this last sally on his fellows, the doomed youth
turned from the keyhole to the room. The first
object which met his eye was his form-master.
The effect was remarkable. Mumford's eyes,
already bulging from long straining at the keyhole,
nearly fell from his head; he turned deadly
pale; and finally, with a whoop of terror, he
dashed from the room, never stopping till he
reached the seclusion of his study in his tutor's
house.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not punished, for Ham knew well that
no further penalty was required. The Lower
Shell, however, unanimously voted Mumford
"an abject blighter," and restored Pip to his old
post.</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly a year passed. Pip was now fifteen.
He had stayed at the preparatory school for a
year longer than most boys, owing to an attack
of mumps; but his appearance was so youthful
and his mental abilities so limited, that he might
easily have passed, as his friend Mumford frequently
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
remarked, for twelve. Mr. Hanbury was
not often puzzled by a boy's brain, but in Pip's
case he had to admit himself baffled.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can't make the boy out," he said to his colleague,
the Reverend William Mortimer (usually
called "Uncle Bill"), who was Pip's house-tutor.
"He has a wonderful memory, but is either
unable or unwilling to think. He prefers to learn
a page of easy history by heart, and repeat it
like a parrot, rather than read it through and give
me the substance of it in his own words."</p>

<p class="indent">"Anything for a change," grunted Uncle Bill.
"I would cheerfully barter my entire form of
imbeciles for one such youth. Look here: here
is Atkinson, with the body of a camel and the
mind of a hedgehog, who has been in my form
for three years, and thinks that <i>De mortuis nil
nisi bonum</i> is a good ending for a hexameter.
And that boy's mother came and called on me
last term for an hour and a half, and confided
to me that a boy of Lancelot's eager spirit and
delicate organism might be inclined to overwork
himself. I suppose this other boy's mother,&mdash;no,
by the way, he hasn't got one,&mdash;his father
is a big West-End doctor. The boy must have
been left very much to himself in his childhood.
He has never read a story-book in his life, and
the cricket news is all that he reads in the papers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! is he a cricketer?" said Hanbury.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
"On paper: his real performances are very
moderate. He will tell you the batting and
bowling average of every first-class cricketer,
though."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't think I have come across him in
that line yet. I am glad he knows something.
Well, I am off to my classroom."</p>

<p class="indent">"What? At this hour of the afternoon?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; a meeting with a few young friends to
discuss various points in the history of Samson.
Four of them, including our young friend. Infernal
rot, these Sunday preparations! The boys
don't learn the work, and the average form-master
can't explain it. They ought to be lumped
together on Monday mornings for you to take,
padre."</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite right, my son," replied Uncle Bill.
"Last term Kifford told his form that a phylactery
was a kind of musical instrument. Well,
cut along. Be gentle with them."</p>

<p class="indent">It was a very hot afternoon in June. Hanbury
found four discontented young persons
awaiting him. He was wont to be lenient over
the Scripture lesson, and a misplaced confidence
in this fact had led the quartette to their downfall.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, let us get this business finished," he
said briskly. "Are you all ready to be questioned?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>
The quartette expressed their readiness to endure
the most searching cross-examination.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, then. Sit down quickly and write
out, in your own words, an account of the events
in chapter thirteen."</p>

<p class="indent">Four pens began to scratch, three vigorously,
the last more diffidently. At the end of twenty
minutes Mr. Hanbury called a halt.</p>

<p class="indent">"Show it up," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Four inky manuscripts were laid before him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me see," he continued. "Manoah&mdash;angel&mdash;sacrifice&mdash;Nazarite&mdash;yes."
He glanced
swiftly through the papers. "You can go, you
three; but you, my young friend,"&mdash;he laid a
heavy hand on Pip's unkempt head,&mdash;"will
stay and talk to me."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a hasty scuttling of feet, the banging
of a door, and Pip was left alone with his
master.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip sighed and glanced out of the window,
through which came the regular knock, knock,
of innumerable bats against innumerable balls
all along the long line of nets.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come along to my study," said Hanbury.
"No, no, I'm not going to execute you this time,"
as Pip looked a little apprehensive.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hanbury occupied two rooms in a corner
of Mr. Mortimer's house, and thither Pip was
conducted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
"Now, young man, sit down in that armchair."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip obeyed, and took his seat on the extreme
edge.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are a queer customer," said Mr. Hanbury
meditatively. "You know ten times as
much about that chapter as Marsh or Stokes or
Fox, and yet you produced this. Look at it."</p>

<p class="indent">It certainly was an interesting document.
Pip, unable to grasp the main facts of the simple
narrative set forth, had adopted the, to him,
easier expedient of learning the chapter, or portions
of it, by heart. The result was a curious
framework of absolutely valueless but fairly correct
quotations, and an utter absence of anything
in the shape of coherent information.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent">"<i>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight
of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hands
of the Philistines forty years.</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>And an angel appeared unto the woman and
said....</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>And the woman came to her husband and said....</i>"</p></div>

<p class="indent">Here the manuscript came to an inky termination.</p>

<p class="indent">"What are these blanks for?" inquired Ham.</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn't remember what they said, sir,"
explained Pip, "so I put blanks."</p>

<p class="indent">"H'm; I see. It gives their remarks rather an
expurgated appearance, though. But look here,
old man," he continued, not unkindly, "one
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
quarter of the labour that you spent on learning
this stuff by heart&mdash;you have got the first verse
quite correct, you see&mdash;would have enabled you,
if rightly applied, to give the gist of the story in
your own words, which was all I wanted. Now,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip looked at him honestly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, good gracious, when you read a novel&mdash;say
Sherlock Holmes&mdash;do you find it easier to
learn it by heart rather than gather the meaning
as you go along?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have never read a novel, sir," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then, any book?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have never read any books, except the ones
in school, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see I am dealing with a phenomenon," said
Mr. Hanbury. "My poor friend, do you mean to
say that your knowledge of books is bounded by
C√¶sar and Arabella Buckley? What did you do
in your extreme youth? Didn't you ever read
fairy tales? Haven't you heard of Cinderella or
Jack the Giant-Killer?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, your par&mdash;" Mr. Hanbury stopped.
He remembered what Father William had told
him, and he realised that home without a mother
may indeed be a strange place.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Pip, well back in his chair
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
now, sat looking curiously at this large man,
who appeared to be genuinely distressed by his
ignorance of fairy tales. Presently the master
continued,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you never read anything?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, the papers, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, that's better. What part?"</p>

<p class="indent">"All the cricket."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you a keen cricketer, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm no good, sir, but I am keen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, trot down and change, and then we'll
go to the field and I'll run over your points at
a net. We will see if you are as good a cricketer
as you are a scholar. Stay and have some cake
first. Perhaps you will excuse me if I smoke a
pipe. Masters have their vices, you see. I
haven't smoked for nearly three hours."</p>

<p class="indent">So the pair sat, Pip with a large piece of cake
balanced delicately on his knee, morbidly anxious
not to spill crumbs on the floor; and Hanbury
lolling back in his armchair, smoking his
pipe and surveying this sturdy youth before him,
who knew every cricketer's average and had
never heard of Cinderella.</p>

<p class="indent">As Pip was changing into flannels a few minutes
later he encountered Mumford.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come to the grub-shop," said that hero.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't," said Pip shortly. "Seen the comb
anywhere?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
"Comb? What for?" said Mumford, who
considered parting the hair during term-time an
affectation.</p>

<p class="indent">"My hair, of course, silly swine," replied Pip,
without heat.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must be cracked! Come to the grub-shop,"
reiterated his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't. Promised to go to a net with Ham."</p>

<p class="indent">And Pip, having worked up the conversation
to this artistic climax, departed, leaving Mumford,
who was not an athlete, in a state of incoherent
amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hanbury presently arrived at the net,
with two more small boys picked up on the way.
Each was given an innings, with a little helpful
coaching, Pip coming last. He stood up to the
bowling manfully, and occasionally slogged one of
his weaker brethren; but his bat was anything
but straight, and Ham bowled him at will.</p>

<p class="indent">"M' yes," said Mr. Hanbury, "you are only an
average lot of batsmen. Can any of you bowl?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a respectful chorus of "No, sir,"
as custom demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, try. I am going to have a knock."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip and company bowled a few laborious
overs, and speedily proved that their estimate
of their own powers was based upon truth, their
preceptor treating their deliveries with little
ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;72]</span>
Finally they were ranged in a semicircle, and
Ham gave them fielding practice.</p>

<p class="indent">Here Pip felt more at home. He was quick on
his feet and possessed a "nippy" pair of hands.
His ground fielding was especially good.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo!" cried Mr. Hanbury, as Pip got to a
ball which kept low down on his left, and returned
it particularly smartly; "which hand did
you throw in that ball with, young man?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip surveyed two grubby paws doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think it was my left, sir," he said apologetically.
"I can't help it sometimes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ambidextrous, eh? Catch this. Now, throw
it in again&mdash;left hand."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip did so, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you ever bowl left-handed?" was the
next inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, just come to a net for a few minutes.
You other people can cut off to tea now."</p>

<p class="indent">The tea-bell had just rung, and the field was
emptying rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, my son," said the master, "you are
going to bowl to me with your left hand. Plug
them in."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip did so. His first ball was a fast half-volley,
and was promptly treated as it deserved.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, another. Take my ball. The groundboy
will field yours."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
Pip, full of importance at having some one to
field for him, bowled again. This time he sent
down a good length ball. Mr. Hanbury stepped
out to it, played right outside it, and next moment
his leg-stump was lying on the ground. He
was clean bowled.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_4" id="CHAPTER_4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>PIP FINDS HIS VOCATION</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Hanbury</span> made no comment, but requested
Pip to bowl again. "A good fast one,"
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, with the most natural air in the world,
obeyed orders. This time he bowled a yorker,
somewhere in the direction of the off-stump.
Mr. Hanbury did not trouble to play it, but
chopped his bat down into the block-hole to stop
it. The ball, however, chiefly owing to the fact
that it curled some inches in the air, missed his
bat and bowled him off his pads.</p>

<p class="indent">"One more," said Ham.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, divided between elation at bowling a master
and apprehension as to the consequences
thereof, delivered his fourth ball&mdash;a full pitch
to the off this time. Bad ball as it was, the curl
in the air was most apparent; but Ham, who
took the measure of most bowling after the
third ball, stepped across, and, playing apparently
about three inches inside it, caught it
fairly and sent it flying.</p>

<p class="indent">"That will do, thanks," he said. "Now, run
off to tea, but drop into my study after prayers
for a minute."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Pip made his appearance very promptly after
prayers.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hanbury, who was smoking and correcting
exercises, nodded to a chair, and after a few minutes'
silence, broken by sundry grunts and the
thud of a merciless blue pencil, put down his
work and addressed Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, my man, I want to have a word with
you. You are what is known as a natural bowler.
Why you didn't find it out for yourself I can't
think. Didn't you, in your extreme infancy,
often feel an inclination to stir your porridge
with your left hand?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip reflected; and sundry nursery incidents, of
no previous import, suddenly acquired a new
significance in his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," he said, "I did. But my nur&mdash;my
people used to tell me not to, and I got out
of the way of it, I suppose."</p>

<p class="indent">"They always do it," said Ham sympathetically.
"Now, listen. A man may be the fastest
and straightest bowler in the world, but unless
he has <i>pitch</i> he has nothing, nothing, nothing!
A straight ball is no good if it is a long hop
or a full pitch, and the only way to acquire the
art is to practise and practise and practise until
you can drop the ball on a threepenny-bit at
twenty yards. Now, if I take you for half an
hour at a net after tea for the next few weeks,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
will you agree to do something for me in return?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip agreed, without asking what the conditions
might be.</p>

<p class="indent">"What I want you to do," said Ham, "is this."
He led the way to the bookshelves at the side
of the room. "I want you to read some books
for me. Any books will do, but you must read
<i>something</i>. I should advise you to begin on
something easy. Here are three. This one is
called 'Treasure Island'; this big one is 'The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'; and the yellow
one is 'Vice Vers√¢.' (Don't be afraid: it's all
English inside.) Which will you have?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was somewhat dazed by this eccentric
man's behaviour, but he had sufficient sense left
to choose the smallest of the proffered volumes.
Then he said timidly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Would I have any chance of getting into the
Junior House Eleven, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"M' well, perhaps. Now, hook it. After tea
to-morrow at my net, mind."</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening Mr. Hanbury, enjoying
the hospitality of Uncle Bill, remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry the St. Dunstan's match is over
for this year."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?" inquired his host.</p>

<p class="indent">"Because we could have beaten them. Anyhow,
we shall do it next year."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
"Why this confidence?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because," said Hanbury, "I propose this day
month to introduce to the school the finest bowler
that it has seen since old Hewett's time."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip stuck to his side of the bargain manfully.
He religiously waded through "Treasure Island,"
marking with a pencil the place when he knocked
off work for the day. The fascination of the
story affected even his barbaric mind, but the
effort of taking it all in more than outweighed
the pleasure. "Sherlock Holmes" he voted dull;
he made no conjectures as to the solution of each
mystery, and consequently the pleasure of anticipating
the result was lost to him. "Vice Vers√¢"
pleased him most, though the idea of a girl running
at large in a boys' school struck his celibate
mind as "utter rot."</p>

<p class="indent">But in return for all this aimless drudgery he
had the unspeakable joy of bowling to Ham
every night for a short time after tea, at a quiet
net in a corner of the big field. The term was
not nearly half over, and already he could bring
the ball down with tolerable certainty somewhere
near a postcard laid for him upon the pitch,
five times out of seven,&mdash;and that, too, without
in any way spoiling the curl in the air by which
his teacher appeared to set so much store. He
was also permitted to bowl one fast ball per over,
an indulgence which comforted him mightily;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
for like every other cricketer who ever lived, he
imagined that he was a heaven-sent fast bowler.</p>

<p class="indent">To his unutterable disappointment he was not
chosen for his Junior House Eleven, though it
included such confirmed dotards as Mumford.
The truth was that Mr. Hanbury had sent for
Marsh, the captain of Pip's house, and asked
as a personal favour that Pip might not be put
in the team.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know these Junior House-Matches," he
said. "The boy will either not be put on to bowl
at all, or else he will be kept on for forty or fifty
overs, tiring himself out and undoing all the
work of the past five weeks. Leave him with me
for another fortnight, and we'll see. I can't have
growing plants strained in any way."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is he really good, sir?" said Marsh. "I
haven't seen him play for a long time, and then
he seemed no better than most of the other
kids."</p>

<p class="indent">"That was when he was bowling right-handed,"
said Ham. "Come and see him to-morrow,
at my net. Look here, I will make a bargain
with you. When is the House-Match proper,
the Final, the big affair, between you and the
Hittites?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A fortnight on Tuesday, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you may play him in that match, on
the understanding that he is not to bowl for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
more than five overs at a time. I'll have him
in good order for you, but he mustn't be overworked."</p>

<p class="indent">Marsh, after a glance at Pip's form at Ham's
net next day, readily agreed to the proposition.</p>

<p class="indent">A week later Pip was informed by Mumford,
during the French hour, of a curious clerical
error in the list containing the names of the
Hivite House Eleven, which had been put up
that morning. Marsh, it appeared, in a fit of
laughable absent-mindedness, had filled the last
place in the list with the name of Pip, instead
of that of one Elliot, who had occupied that
position in the previous round.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rum mistake to make," said Mumford, with
obvious sincerity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very," said Pip shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather a jest," continued the imaginative
Mumford, "if he didn't notice it, and you turned
out on the day with the rest of the Eleven
instead of Elliott!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Jolly comic!" said Pip, without enthusiasm.
He was a modest youth, but, like other and
older men, he derived no pleasure from hearing
his low opinion of himself so heartily endorsed
by his friends.</p>

<p class="indent">However, his name remained on the list, and
on the great day he did turn out with the Eleven,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
going in last and being bowled first ball, much
to the gratification of Mr. Elliott.</p>

<p class="indent">The Hivites made a hundred and seventy-eight,&mdash;not
a bad score, as house-matches go.
Then the Hittites took the field. They sent in
a red-headed youth named Evans, and a long,
lean individual who rejoiced in the thoroughly
incongruous nickname of "Tiny." He played
with an appallingly straight bat, but seldom took
liberties with the bowling.</p>

<p class="indent">The opening of the innings was not eventful.
House-matches are very much alike as a class.
Everybody knows everybody else's game to a
nicety, and the result is usually a question of
nerves. Tiny and Evans poked systematically
and exasperatingly at every ball sent down; the
clumps of dark-blue Hittites and pink Hivites
round the field subsided into recumbent apathy;
and Pip, who was fielding at short slip, began
to feel that if house-matches were all as dull as
this one he might get through without further
disgracing himself.</p>

<p class="indent">But Marsh, the bowler, was also a cricketer.
He saw that Evans, who was not naturally a
defensive player, was getting very tired of poking
to order, and resolved to tempt him. He
accordingly sent down one of the worst balls ever
seen on the school pitch. Evans wavered for
a moment, but, remembering his orders, let it go
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
by. It was followed by another, exactly like it:
once again Evans restrained his itching bat. But
the third was too much for him, and he smote
it incontinently over the ropes, to the huge delight
of the Hittites.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now he's got his eye in!" remarked Master
Simpson of the Hittites to Master Mumford,
who was sitting beside him on the railings.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rot!" replied that youth, as in duty bound,
but without conviction. "Any ass could see that
Marsh gave him that ball on purpose."</p>

<p class="indent">"On purpose? What for?" inquired Simpson
doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a question to ask!" replied Mumford,
casting about for an answer. "Of course you
don't know enough about the game, but the
reason why Marsh bowled that particular ball
was&mdash;Hooray! Hoor-a-a-ay-ee-ah-ooh! Well
held, sir! What did I say, young Simpson?"</p>

<p class="indent">For Evans, throwing caution to the winds, had
lashed out at a good ball, the last of Marsh's
over, and it was now reposing safely in the hands
of Mid-off.</p>

<p class="indent">Another disaster befell the Hittites a few minutes
later. Tiny, who had been stepping out and
playing forward with the irritating accuracy of
an automaton, played just inside a ball from the
Hivite fast bowler, Martin. The ball glanced off
his bat, and almost at the same moment Pip became
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
conscious of a violent pain, suggestive of
red-hot iron, in his right arm-pit. He clapped his
hand to the part affected, and to his astonishment
drew forth the ball, to a storm of applause
from the delighted Hivites, while Tiny retired,
speechless and scarlet, to the Pavilion.</p>

<p class="indent">But trouble was in store for the Hivites. The
two new batsmen were the opposing captain, one
Hewett, a smiter of uncompromising severity,
and a somewhat amorphous and pimply youth,
destitute of nerves, who was commonly addressed
as "Scrabbler." These twain treated the
firm of Marsh and Martin with a disrespect that
amounted almost to discourtesy. The score rose
from forty-five to a hundred, and from a hundred
to a hundred and thirty-five, notwithstanding
the substitution of two fresh bowlers of established
reputation and fair merit. The Hivites
began to look unhappy. Their fielding, which
hitherto had been well up to the mark, now
deteriorated; and when the Scrabbler was missed
at the wicket from a snick that was heard all over
the ground, Master Simpson became so offensive
that Mumford found it necessary to withdraw
out of earshot.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Marsh, having obeyed the law
which says that when your first-eleven colour-men
have failed, you must try your second-eleven
colour-men; and when you have done that, you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
may begin to speculate on outsiders, decided to
put Pip on. He accordingly tossed him the ball
at the beginning of the next over.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip had been living for this moment ever since
his name had appeared in the list, and he had
carefully rehearsed all the movements necessary
to the occasion. He would pick up the ball negligently,
hand his cap to the umpire, and place his
field with a few comprehensive motions of his arm.
He would then toss down a few practice balls to
the wicket-keeper, and, after a final glance round
the field, proceed to bring the Hittite innings to
an inglorious conclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">But, alas! whether it was from insufficient
rehearsal, or blue funk, Pip's performance was
a dreadful failure. He forgot to hand his cap to
the umpire; he made no attempt to place his
field; and so far was he from casting cool glances
around him before commencing his onslaught that
he was only prevented, by the heavy hand of the
adjacent Scrabbler, from beginning to bowl before
the fielders had crossed over.</p>

<p class="indent">And when he did begin, the ball which was to
have made a crumbling ruin of Hewett's wicket
proved to be a fast full-pitch to leg; the second
ball was a long-hop to the off; and the third,
which had originally been intended to complete
Pip's hat-trick, nearly annihilated the gentleman
who was fielding point. Marsh was very patient,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span>
and made no comment as ball after ball was
despatched to the boundary. He would have
liked to give the boy time to find his feet, but this
sort of thing was too expensive. After two inglorious
overs Pip retired once more to second
slip, with his inscrutable countenance as inscrutable
as ever, but his heart almost bursting beneath
his white shirt, with shame and humiliation
and a downright grief. It was the first tragedy
of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">But he had his revenge a moment later. The
Scrabbler, with a pretty late cut, despatched a
fast ball from Martin straight to Pip. Pip
automatically clapped his heels together and
ducked down to the ball, but just a moment
too late. He felt the ball glance off each instep
and pass behind him. The Scrabbler's partner,
seeing that Pip had not stopped the ball, called
to him to come; then, seeing that the ball had
only rolled a few yards, called to him to go back.
But Pip by this time had reached the ball. The
Scrabbler made a frantic leap back into safety.
Pip's long arm shot out, and as the batsman
hung for a moment between heaven and earth
in his passage back to the crease, he saw wickets
and bails disintegrate themselves in wild confusion
in response to a thunderbolt despatched
from Pip's left hand at a range of six yards.</p>

<p class="indent">The partnership was over at last, and the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Hittites offered little more resistance. They
were all out in another half hour, for a total of
two hundred and fifteen,&mdash;a score long enough
to cause the Hivites to confer gloomily among
themselves and ignore the unseemly joy of the
Hittites. So play ended for the day.</p>

<p class="indent">The match was to be resumed on the following
Thursday, two days later. On Wednesday evening
Ham sat smoking in his room. He was expecting
Pip, who generally chose that time for
returning works of fiction. On this occasion Pip
was rather long in coming, and when he did come
he was not the usual Pip. He had not encountered
his form-master in private since the house-match,
and was uncertain of his reception. Only
the strictest sense of duty brought his faltering
feet to Mr. Hanbury's door, and it was with
downcast eye and muffled voice that he proffered
"Handley Cross" in exchange for "The Jungle
Book."</p>

<p class="indent">Ham knew his man, and discreetly avoided
cricketing topics for the first five minutes. He
talked of Mr. Jorrocks, of Mowgli, of the weather&mdash;of
anything, in fact, rather than half-volleys
and full-pitches. It was Pip, with his usual
directness, who opened the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think it will keep fine, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sweltering hot, I expect."</p>

<p class="indent">There was an awkward pause. Then Pip said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
"I'm&mdash;I'm awfully sorry, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Hanbury understood, and he glowed inwardly
to think that the first feeling of this small boy,
whose very soul was wrung by the knowledge
that he had received his first chance in life and
thrown it away, should be one of regret for
having disappointed his teacher rather than one
of commiseration for himself. Mr. Hanbury was
still young and very human, and he felt glad
that he had read Pip aright, and not pinned his
faith to the wrong sort of boy.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear man," he said, "you did exactly
what I expected you to do&mdash;no more and no
less. You bowled erratically and fielded splendidly."
(The idea that he had fielded well had
never occurred to Pip.) "I was sorry about the
bowling, but I knew you must go through the
experience. The best bowler in the world never
remembered to bowl with his head his first match.
He just did what you did&mdash;shut his eyes and
plugged them in as hard as he could."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip nodded. That was exactly what he had
done.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's what I meant when I told you the
other day that your education was not half
completed. I meant that you might be able to
knock over a stump at a net all day and yet not
be able to keep your head before a crowd. You
will do well now you have found your feet. You
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
fielded like a man yesterday, and you'll bowl like
a demon to-morrow. I expect great things of
you, so keep your tail up, young man, and&mdash;By
Jove, I promised to see Mr. Mortimer before
nine! Excuse me a moment."</p>

<p class="indent">Ham bolted from the room.</p>

<p class="indent">For Pip, the imperturbable, the impenetrable,
was&mdash;<i>horresco referens</i>&mdash;in tears! After all,
he was barely fifteen, and he had endured a good
deal already&mdash;the quiet disappointment of
Marsh, the thinly veiled scorn of the deposed
Elliott, and the half-amused contempt of the rest
of the house. He had taken them all in his usual
impassive way, and the critics who gathered in
knots after the game and condemned Marsh for
putting "an absolute kid" into the House Eleven,
never suspected that the "kid" in question
was struggling, beneath an indifferent exterior,
between an intense desire for sympathy and a
stubborn determination not to show it. And so
these words from his beloved Ham, from whom
he had expected at the best disappointed silence,
brought to his overwrought soul that relief
which he so badly needed; and a large tear,
trickling down his nose, warned Mr. Hanbury
to remember a pressing engagement elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip soon recovered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lucky Ham had to go out then," he soliloquised,
"or he'd have seen me blub."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
Ham returned after a discreet interval, and
after a few words of wisdom and encouragement
dismissed Pip to bed in a greatly improved frame
of mind.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Hivites began their second innings thirty-seven
runs to the bad. This fact had impressed
itself upon the mind of Marsh, the captain, and
he decided, in his vigorous way, that if anything
was to be done he must do it himself. He accordingly
went in first, accompanied by a confirmed
"stone-waller," and proceeded to break the
hearts of the Hittite bowlers. Nothing could
shake the steadiness of the two players. The
most beautiful balls were sent down to them&mdash;balls
which pitched halfway and wavered alluringly,
waiting to be despatched to square-leg,
half-volleys, full-pitches, wides; but nothing
would tempt them to take liberties. Marsh
played sound cricket, and made runs; but his
companion played a purely defensive game, his
performance being accentuated by a series of
sharp knocks, or dull thuds, according as he
played the ball with his bat or his body. The
arrears had been exactly wiped off when this
hero, in endeavouring to interpose as much of
his adamantine person as possible between his
wicket and a leg-break, lurched heavily backwards
and mowed down all three stumps. He
retired amid applause.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
But the Hivites were not out of the wood. The
next two batsmen succumbed rather unluckily,
the one leg-before, the other caught at the wicket,&mdash;the
two ways in which no batsman is ever
really out,&mdash;and a rot set in. Marsh, it was
true, was playing the innings of his life. All bowling
seemed to come alike to him, and he usually
contrived to score a single at the end of the over
and so prolonged the lives of his various fluttered
partners. But he could not do everything, and
when Pip came in last, the score was only a
hundred and five, of which Marsh had made
seventy.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's previous performance had not been such
as to justify any unbounded confidence in his
supporters; but he certainly shaped better this
time. He had a good eye, and by resolutely
placing his bat in the path of the approaching
ball he achieved the twofold result of keeping
up his wicket and goading the bowlers to impotent
frenzy. Once he survived a whole maiden
over, though he was bombarded with long hops,
tempted with slows, and intimidated with full-pitches
directed at his head. He stood perfectly
still; the ball rebounded from his tough young
person again and again; and now and then,
when the angle of incidence and the angle of
reflection were very obtuse indeed, he and Marsh
ran a leg-bye. The score crept up, Marsh began
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
to get near his century, and the Hivites again
plucked up heart.</p>

<p class="indent">After batting for nearly a quarter of an hour,
Pip, much to his own surprise, scored a run&mdash;four,
to be precise&mdash;due to an entirely inadvertent
snick to the off boundary. This brought the
score up to a hundred and thirty. Directly afterwards
Marsh completed his hundred, with a
mighty drive over the ropes, and "e'en the ranks
of Tuscany," as Uncle Bill observed, "could
scarce forbear to cheer."</p>

<p class="indent">After that Marsh, feeling uncertain as to how
long his companion intended to stay, determined
to make hay while the sun shone. Accordingly
he began to hit. Four fours in one over brought
on a slow bowler, who had to be taken off again
as soon as possible; for even Pip despised him,
and pulled one of his off-balls to square-leg for
three. But this state of affairs was too good to
last. Marsh, who had been smiting all and
sundry since completing his hundred, ran out to
a slow ball from the Hittite captain and missed
it. The wicket-keeper whipped off the bails in a
flash, and the innings was over. The full score
was a hundred and fifty-seven, of which Marsh
had made a hundred and seventeen. Pip scored
seven, not out.</p>

<p class="indent">Verily, this was a match. The Hittites only
wanted a hundred and twenty to win; but a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
hundred and twenty is a big figure to compile
out of the fourth innings of a house-match,
when nerves are snapping like fiddle-strings.
However, it was generally considered that the
Hittites would win by about five wickets, and
Master Simpson, by wagering an ingenious
musical instrument, composed mainly of half a
walnut-shell and a wooden match (invaluable for
irritating nervous masters), against two fives-balls
and a moribund white mouse belonging to
Mumford, in support of his own house, had just
brought himself within the sphere of operations
of the Anti-Gambling League, when the Hivites
went out to the field for the last time.</p>

<p class="indent">Marsh had found an opportunity for a hurried
consultation with Mr. Hanbury.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's no use your going on to bowl at present,"
said his adviser. "You can't knock up a
hundred and expect to take wickets directly
afterwards."</p>

<p class="indent">"Whom shall I begin with, sir? I thought of
Martin and Watkins."</p>

<p class="indent">"Watkins is a broken reed, but he'll last for
three overs. Take him off soon, and if you are
not ready yourself, give our young friend Pip
another trial."</p>

<p class="indent">Marsh cocked a respectful but surprised eye at
his master.</p>

<p class="indent">Hanbury saw the look. "You'll find him a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;92]</span>
very different performer now," he said. "That
little bit of batting will have steadied him nicely.
But don't keep him on too long, even though he
takes wickets. Give him a rest after five overs,
and put him on again later. Make him place his
own field: the experience will be useful to him."</p>

<p class="indent">Things turned out pretty well as Mr. Hanbury
had prophesied. Martin, a steady performer,
kept the runs down at his end; and Watkins, the
broken reed, bowled exactly three good overs, in
the second of which he removed the Hittite captain's
leg-bail with a ball which, as Uncle Bill
observed, "would have beaten the Old Man himself."
After that he fell away, and having been
hit three times for four in his fourth over, was
taken off.</p>

<p class="indent">Marsh was still feeling the effects of his innings,
and decided to take another ten minutes'
rest. He accordingly electrified players and
spectators alike by tossing the ball to Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall win by nine wickets now," said
Master Simpson with decision&mdash;"not five."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear ass," replied Mumford, "he's only
put Pip on for an over to let Martin change ends."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if he bowls as he did last innings Martin
won't get the chance, 'cause Pip will give us all
the runs we want in one over. Let's see: six
sixes are thirty-six, say ten wides, and&mdash;all
right, lousy swine!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;93]</span>
This last remark was delivered from a nettle-bed
behind the railings, and its warmth was due
to the fact that the speaker had been neatly
tilted backwards by a well-directed jog from the
incensed Mr. Mumford's elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">But Pip had no intention of giving away runs
this time. He was proud of the confidence in
him that had been shown; he was burning to retrieve
the disgrace of his last performance; and,
best of all, his glorious spell of batting had
soothed his nerves and accustomed him to public
appearances. He arranged his field quietly, sent
a couple of balls down to the wicket-keeper, and
even remembered to hand his cap to the umpire.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a hush all around the ground as he
ran up to the wicket to deliver his first ball.</p>

<p class="indent">Things were certainly in a critical state. Of
the hundred and twenty runs required to win,
the Hittites had obtained forty-five for the loss
of one wicket. If the present pair could add
another thirty before being separated the match
was practically safe. It was felt that Marsh was
playing a desperate game in risking everything
on the efforts of such a tyro as Pip; and when
the Scrabbler took his stand and prepared to
punish his presumptuous folly, the Hittites made
ready to shout, and the Hivites to decamp to
their house.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's head was quite clear this time. His first
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
two balls were to be as straight as possible and
a good length; the third, if possible, was to be a
fast yorker; the fourth, a good length ball; the
fifth, slow and curly; and the last, Ham had
told him, could be anything he pleased.</p>

<p class="indent">He delivered his first ball as per programme.
The Scrabbler stepped well out to it, calculating,
with his long reach, to be able to smother it
comfortably. Much to his surprise his bat met
with no resistance, for he had planted it quite
two inches outside. The ball passed between
his bat and his legs, whizzed past the leg stump,
and was in the wicket-keeper's hands in a moment.
The bails were whipped off, and the
Scrabbler, who had dragged his foot right over
the crease in his tremendous lunge forward, was
out, stumped as neatly as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">A mighty shout went up as the Scrabbler
retired. Two for forty-five.</p>

<p class="indent">Another batsman took his place. Pip delivered
a ball almost identical with the first. This time
the batsman, a stumpy person, not possessed of
the Scrabbler's reach, played back, and succeeded
in returning the ball to the bowler.
Pleased with this success, and desiring to repeat
it, he made the fatal mistake of deciding on his
next stroke before the ball was bowled. Consequently
he played back to a fast yorker, which,
you will remember, came third on Pip's schedule.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
When he turned round his middle stump was
lying on the ground, and the wicket-keeper was
groping ecstatically for the bails.</p>

<p class="indent">Three for forty-five.</p>

<p class="indent">The next man was the heavy hitter of the
eleven. It was his custom to smite every ball
sent down, including the first, with uncompromising
severity. On this occasion, however, he was
sufficiently impressed with the solemnity of the
occasion to endeavour to block the first ball,
which was Pip's fourth,&mdash;a straight, good-length,
orthodox delivery, rather on the short
side. The ball rebounded from his rigid bat, and
Point just failed to reach it. A little shudder ran
round the ground. The slogger, observing his
escape, came to the conclusion that he might as
well be outed for a slogger as a poker, and lashed
out widely at ball number five, which was a slow
and curly one. Now, since Pip, who felt the real
bowling instinct, which tells a man what the
batsman expects (and prompts him to bowl something
entirely different), surging up hotter and
stronger in his brain every moment, bowled when
still a good two yards behind the crease, the lash-out
came much too soon, and the slogger's bat
was waving wildly in the air what time his bails
were being disturbed by a beautiful curly ball
which bumped, very very gently, into his off-stump.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Four for forty-five.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no mistaking the shout that arose
now. Previous vocal efforts had merely expressed
pleased surprise at a good piece of bowling,
and had voiced the gratifying fact that the
Hivites, though about to be beaten, would not
be disgraced; but the tornado which now rent
the heavens signified that Pip had set the match
on its legs again.</p>

<p class="indent">Our hero had now bowled five balls, all with
his head. He had been holding himself in, bowling
not as he wanted to bowl, but as Ham had
told him to bowl, and as he knew in his heart of
hearts he ought to bowl. But now he was to
have his sixth ball, which he was permitted to
bowl in any way he pleased. Ham should see
something!</p>

<p class="indent">His mentor was sitting under the trees with
Uncle Bill.</p>

<p class="indent">"What will the infant phenomenon give us
this time?" inquired the reverend gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">"Something terrifically fast, probably to leg,"
replied Mr. Hanbury, who knew human nature.</p>

<p class="indent">He was right. The ball caught the batsman
a resounding crack on the back of the thigh, and
sped away to the boundary for four&mdash;a leg-bye.
So ended Pip's first over.</p>

<p class="indent">Martin now resumed at his end. Evans, who
had been a horrified and helpless spectator of his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;97]</span>
companions' downfall, played him in a cautious
manner, as became the occasion, intending to
sneak a run at the end of the over and so face
the redoubtable Pip himself. But it was not to
be. In his anxiety to obtain the necessary run
he attempted to hit a ball which he knew should
have been let alone, and was caught at cover-point.
Five for forty-nine.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more it was Pip's turn. He found himself
confronted by another hard slogger, who,
instead of sticking to his last, trusting to his
eye, and running out to hit, stood stock-still,
and having solemnly planted his bat in what
he imagined was the path of the ball, awaited
developments. The ball, curling like a boomerang,
pitched slightly to leg, broke back, and
bowled him. Six for forty-nine.</p>

<p class="indent">The frenzy of the Hivites was becoming almost
monotonous, and it was hardly capable of augmentation
when Pip bowled another man with
his next ball, bringing his analysis up to five
wickets for no runs.</p>

<p class="indent">"The match is over," said Uncle Bill; "but
it will be interesting to see if he keeps it up to
the end."</p>

<p class="indent">"'Not for competition, but for exhibition
only'&mdash;now," murmured Hanbury dreamily.</p>

<p class="indent">The next man held his bat firmly in the block-hole,
as the best means of combating the third
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
ball of the over,&mdash;the fast yorker,&mdash;and with
the assistance of short-slip, who received the ball
in the pit of his stomach and incontinently
dropped it, disappointed the entire field, friend
and foe alike, by spoiling Pip's hat-trick. The
batsman, a person of unorthodox style, having
succeeded in despatching a yorker to slip, decided
that the best place for a good length ball
would be long-leg. He accordingly stepped in front
of his wicket for the purpose of carrying his intention
into effect; but the ball, much to his surprise
and indignation, evaded the all-embracing sweep
of bat and hit him hard on both shins, with
the result that he was very properly given out
leg-before-wicket.</p>

<p class="indent">The spectators now realised that the match
was as good as over; but curiosity to see how
much longer Pip would continue his extraordinary
entertainment glued them to the spot. Pip
himself had lost all consciousness of the presence
of others. All his little soul was concentrated on
one idea&mdash;to get the last two wickets with the
two balls remaining to him.</p>

<p class="indent">The last batsman but one took his place, and
Pip bowled his slow ball. The batsman watched
it as he had been told to do, and decided in a
weak moment that it was going to be a good
length ball on the off. This being the case, he
proposed to make use of his only stroke, a rather
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
elaborate flourish, which, if it could be engineered
at precisely the right moment, occasionally came
off as a late cut. The one error into which this
lightning calculator fell was the belief that the
ball would pitch off the wicket. It pitched absolutely
straight, got up remarkably quickly,
and, almost before the flourish was half over,
bowled him. Nine for forty-nine.</p>

<p class="indent">The last man walked out slowly, but he had
reached the wicket before Pip noticed him. For
Pip was plunged in thought: he had once more
arrived at the last ball of the over, the ball that
he was to bowl in any way he pleased. A good
deal&mdash;nay, everything&mdash;depended upon it. He
was determined to bowl no more full-pitches to
leg. A yorker, if straight, would almost certainly
settle the fate of this last trembling creature; but
then yorkers are not always straight. A good
length ball, on the other hand, would probably
be blocked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Man in," said the umpire, and suddenly Pip
made up his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">"His sixth ball!" remarked Uncle Bill under
the trees. "What will it be this time, I wonder?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If he wants to do the hat-trick," said Hanbury,
"he must take some risks. No good giving
this fellow a length ball. He'll only block it.
Pip'll have to tempt him."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
And that is what Pip did. He bowled a very
short ball, a very bad ball, a long-hop unspeakable,
on the off side. Now, the batsman was
expecting a good ball, and was prepared to
present to it an immovable bat. But this thing,
this despicable object which lobbed up so temptingly,
ought he to spare it? "Take no risks,"
Hewett had said; but then Hewett was not
expecting this demon bowler to send down tosh
like this. Should he? Could he? Yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes!
He raised his bat uncertainly, and made a
half-hearted pull at the ball. It struck his bat
somewhere on the splice,&mdash;the curl in the air
had deceived one more victim,&mdash;flew up into
the air, and, when it descended, found Pip
waiting for it with a pair of hands that would
at that moment have gripped a red-hot cannonball.</p>

<p class="indent">So the innings ended for forty-nine, and the
Hivites won by seventy-one runs. In two overs
Pip had taken eight wickets (doing the hat-trick
incidentally) for no runs. Verily, in a house-match
all things are possible. He never accomplished
such a feat again, though his seven
wickets for seven runs against the Australians
ten years later, and his four wickets in four balls,
on that historic occasion when the Gentlemen
beat the Players by an innings, were relatively
far greater performances.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;101]</span>
He turned mechanically to the umpire and
took his cap, and was in the act of unrolling his
sleeves, when he was suddenly caught up,
whirled aloft, and carried off towards the pavilion
by a seething wave of frenzied Hivites. Those
enthusiasts who were debarred from supporting
any portion of him contented themselves with
slapping outlying parts of his person and uttering
discordant whoops.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhere beneath his left arm-pit Pip discovered
the inflamed countenance of Master
Mumford.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where's young Simpson?" he screamed in
that worthy's ear, not so much because he wished
to know as to relieve the extreme tension of the
situation.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a senseless and inappropriate question,
but it appeared to bring Mumford's cup
of happiness to overflowing point. Laying his
uncombed head upon Pip's horizontal stomach,
with tears of joy streaming down his cheeks, he
gasped,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"H-he went down to the house to g-get his
k-kodak as soon as y-you were put on bowling, so
as to phuph-photograph the winning hit. And
oh, he s-said they would w-win by nine wickets!
He h-hasn't got back yet."</p>

<p class="indent">But he was wrong. There stood Master Simpson,
ready to photograph the winning hit. But,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
like the Briton and the sportsman that he was,
he made the best of a bad job and photographed
Pip instead. And an enlarged copy of that snapshot
hangs in Pip's smoking-room to-day, to
witness if I lie.</p>

<h3>LINKLATER</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Linklater</span> came to school after Pip,&mdash;one
year, to be precise,&mdash;but by the time that both
had attained to the dignity of seniors they were
firm friends. They were a curiously assorted
couple. Pip at the age of eighteen was as inscrutable
and reserved as ever, though his popularity
with the school was unbounded, and his influence,
when he chose to exert it, enormous. He
had already been a member of the Eleven for
three years, and should by rights this year have
been captain. But alas! though Pip had been
duly washed by the high tides of promiscuous
September promotions out of the all-glorious
Lower Shell into the Upper Shell, and from the
Upper Shell by the next inundation into the Fifth,
he had not as yet qualified for a Monitorship.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater was a handsome, breezy, rather
boisterous youth, quick of tongue and limber of
limb. He possessed his fair share of brains, but
not the corresponding inclination to use them;
and he was a natural athlete of the most attractive
type,&mdash;a graceful mover, a pretty bat,
and a beautiful racquets player. But somehow
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span>
he was not universally popular. Everybody was
his friend, it is true, but that was chiefly because
nobody cares to be the avowed antagonist of a
man who possesses a sharp tongue and no scruples
about using it, especially when these gifts are
backed by such undoubted assets as membership
of the Fifteen and Eleven. There was something
not quite right about Linklater. Perhaps
he was too grownup in his manners. He was
popular, too, with masters, which is not invariably
a good sign in a boy.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, he was not quite so grownup at eighteen
as when he first came to Grandwich; and thereby
hangs a tale.</p>

<p class="indent">At every public school there are certain things&mdash;each
school has its own list&mdash;which are "not
done." Not done, that is, until one has
achieved fame,&mdash;until one is a "blood," or a
"dook," or a "bug" (or whatever they call it at
your school, sir); until a boy has fought his way
into that aristocracy&mdash;the most exclusive aristocracy
in the world&mdash;in which brains, as such,
count for nothing, birth has no part, and wealth
is simply disregarded; where genuine ability occasionally
gains a precarious footing, and then
only by disguising itself as something else; but
to which muscle, swiftness of foot, and general
ability to manipulate a ball with greater dexterity
than one's neighbour is received unquestioningly,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
joyfully, proudly. Dear old gentlemen,
who are brought down to distribute the prizes
after lunch on Speech Day, invariably point to
Simpkins major, who has obtained a prize for
Greek Iambics and another for Latin Prose, as
the summit of the scholastic universe; and they
beseech Simpkins's "fellow-scholars" not to be
down-hearted because they are not like Simpkins.
"We do not all get&mdash;er&mdash;ten talents,
boys," observes the old gentleman soothingly,
with a half-deferential bob towards the Head,
as if to apologise for quoting Scripture before a
clerical authority. He next proceeds to hold out
strong hopes to his audience that if they work
hard they may possibly&mdash;who knows?&mdash;come
some day to resemble Simpkins major. At this
all the parents, forgetful of their own youth, applaud,
and the "fellow-scholars," about fifty
per cent of whom do not know Simpkins by sight,
while the remainder seldom meet him in a passage
without kicking him, grin sheepishly, and
take it out of Simpkins afterwards. The real
heroes of the school, if only the dear old gentleman
would realise, or remember, the fact, are
those rather dull-looking youths, with incipient
moustaches and large chests, who sit cracking
nuts in the back row.</p>

<p class="indent">But this is by the way. Let us return to the
things which are "not done" by the proletariat.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
The following are a few extracts from the unwritten
but rigid code of Grandwich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent">1. You must wear your tie in a sailor's knot&mdash;not
in a bow.</p>

<p class="indent">2. A new boy must not speak to any one unless
spoken to first.</p>

<p class="indent">3. You must <i>not</i> shave until you are in the Fifteen
or Eleven; after that you must shave every Saturday
night, whether you need it or not.</p></div>

<p class="indent">There was a merciful proviso attached to the
last remarkable enactment&mdash;namely, that all
whose growth of hair had outrun their social
status might shave to an extent sufficient to
make them presentable, provided that the operation
did not take place in public. Consequently
many undistinguished but hairy persons were
compelled to shave in bed at night after the
gas was out. I have often wondered what their
mothers would have thought if they had known.
Fortunately there is much in our lives that our
mothers never hear of. If they did, public
schools (among many other things) would cease
to exist.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, Linklater, who, as has been already
mentioned, was a precocious youth,&mdash;a typical
cock-of-the-walk from a preparatory school,&mdash;spent
his first few weeks at Grandwich in running
foul of all the most cherished traditions of that
historic foundation. He arrived in a neat bowtie,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
and proceeded to wear the same, despite the
pointed criticisms of a multitude of counsellors,
for the space of a week; at the end of which
period it was taken from his neck by a self-appointed
committee of the Lower Fourth.
Finding that his eccentricities were earning him
a certain amount of unpopularity, Linklater
decided, like the born opportunist that he was,
to allay popular feeling by a timely distribution
of largesse. He accordingly paid a visit to the
school tuck-shop, where he expended two shillings
and sixpence on assorted confectionery. On his
way back he encountered no less a person than
Rumsey, the captain of the Eleven, and, feeling
that he might as well conciliate all classes while
he was about it, cried, "Catch, there!" and
launched the largest sweet he could find in the
bag in the direction of Rumsey. The feelings of
that potentate on receiving a <i>marron glac√©</i> in
the middle of his waistcoat from a diminutive
fag deprived him for the moment of all power
to move or speak, so that the unconscious Linklater,
passing on unscathed, lived to tell the tale,
and subsequently to hear it told and retold by
hysterical <i>raconteurs</i> to delighted audiences for
months afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">"Heard the latest about that new bloke?"
inquired Master Mumford of Pip one evening,
under cover of the continuous hum of conversation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
which always characterised "prep" in the
Hivite house.</p>

<p class="indent">"What new bloke?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Linklater. Seen him?"</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, Pip had seen him at nets that day, and
had noticed that he was a jolly neat bat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Notice his boots?" pursued Mumford.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't say I did."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, they were white!"</p>

<p class="indent">Master Mumford fairly overflowed with happy
laughter at the richness of the jest. The wearing
of white buckskin boots was one of the privileges
of the First Eleven, and Linklater had run counter
to custom and habit again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh," said Pip, "I suppose he didn't know."</p>

<p class="indent">This childishly lenient view of the case did
not appeal to Mumford, who, with all the small-minded
man's respect for the letter of the law,
was thirsting to punish the evildoer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Beastly side!" he ejaculated, "that's all.
We are going to fill them with soap and water
after prep, and put a notice beside them telling
him not to stick on so much of it. I'm writing
it now. How many <i>e's</i> are there in beastly?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dunno," replied Pip shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you come and help?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. He looks rather a decent chap. He's
only been here a week; he may not know about
white boots."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
"Ought to, then," snapped the bloodthirsty
Mumford. "Other people find things out all
right."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not all," grunted Pip. "How about stamps?"</p>

<p class="indent">Master Mumford turned his back with some
deliberation, and addressed himself severely to
the labours of composition. Once, during his
first week at Grandwich, he had called at the
Head Master's, and having, after a wordy encounter
with an unexpected butler in the hall,
succeeded in pushing his way into the study,
had endeavoured, in faithful pursuance of the
custom in vogue at his private school, to purchase
a penny stamp for his Sunday letter from
the stupefied autocrat within.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater's white boots were duly filled with
soap and water, but Pip was not present at the
ceremony. He sought out the victim next evening
and invited him to supper&mdash;sardines, and
condensed milk spread on biscuits&mdash;in his study
after prayers. An invitation from Pip was something
sought after among the Juniors in "Uncle
Bill's" house, for Pip, though only fifteen, was
regarded as a certainty for his Eleven colours
this year, after his electrifying performance on
last year's house-match.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater gratefully accepted the invitation,
and the two became friends from that day. They
possessed opposite qualities. Pip admired Linklater's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
vivacity and <i>bonhomie</i>, while Linklater
was attracted by Pip's solid muscle and undemonstrative
ability to "do things." But cricket
was their common bond. Linklater was almost
as promising a bat as Pip was a bowler, and the
two rose to eminence side by side. But despite
their early proficiency, it was fated that neither
should be Captain of the Eleven,&mdash;Pip for reasons
already stated, and Linklater for another,
which came about in this way.</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly every schoolboy has a <i>b√™te noire</i> among
the masters, and every master has at least one
<i>b√™te noire</i> among the boys. Fortunately it very
seldom happens that the antipathy is mutual.
If it is, look out for trouble, especially when the
boy has a dour temper and the master is fault-finding
and finicky. Such an one was Mr. Bradshaw,
late Scholar of Balliol College, Oxford,
and a born fool.</p>

<p class="indent">Hostilities began early. On Linklater's first
appearance in the Lower Sixth, Mr. Bradshaw
remarked unfavourably on the shape of his
collar, and elicited loud and sycophantic laughter&mdash;which
is always music in the ears of men of
his type&mdash;by several facetious comments on the
colour of his tie. Linklater chafed and glowered,
and muttered "Swine!" under his breath,&mdash;symptoms
of discomfiture which only roused
Mr. Bradshaw to further humorous efforts.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Thereafter the two waged perpetual warfare.
Linklater took his opponent's measure with great
accuracy, and then advanced to battle. He discovered
that Mr. Bradshaw was deaf in his left
ear. He therefore made a point, whenever possible,
of sitting on that side and making obscene
noises. Mr. Bradshaw was extremely bald, and
ashamed of the fact. Linklater had noted in his
study of the Scriptures that the prophet Elisha
had suffered from the same infirmity: consequently
Mr. Bradshaw found his blackboard
adorned every morning for a month with the
single word ELISHA in staring capitals. When
Mr. Bradshaw was irritable Linklater was serenely
cheerful; when Mr. Bradshaw was blandly
sarcastic Linklater was densely stupid; and after
ostentatious efforts to understand his preceptor's
innuendoes, would shake his head pityingly,
with a patient sigh at such ill-timed levity.</p>

<p class="indent">So the battle went on. Every schoolboy knows
what it must have been like. Matters were
bound to come to a crisis. One morning, during
a Cicero lesson, the form came upon a Greek
expression amid the Latin text, and Mr. Bradshaw,
who rather fancied himself at this sort
of thing, added a touch of distinction to his
translation by rendering the word in French.
The form received this flight of scholarship without
enthusiasm, merely wondering in their hearts
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
how any man could be such an unmitigated ass
as to be desirous of elucidating for them a language
of which they knew but little by translating
it into another of which they knew still less.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, <i>√©lan</i> is exactly the right translation,"
quoth Mr. Bradshaw, well pleased. "There is
always a way out of every difficulty if we only
look for it. Get on!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, sir, what does <i>√©lan</i> mean, exactly?"
inquired Linklater, not because he wished to
know, but in the hope that "Braddy" would
waste several precious minutes in explaining.</p>

<p class="indent">The master rose to the bait.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mean? Bless my soul, what a question!
Not know? Here, tell him, somebody&mdash;Martin,
Levesley, Smith, Forbes, next, next, next!"</p>

<p class="indent">Various futile translations were offered, and
Mr. Bradshaw stormed again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you fellows do <i>anything</i> in the French
hour except eat bananas?" he inquired. (Deferential
sniggers.) "What are French lessons but
an excuse for idleness? Really, I must ask the
Head&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">They let him run on, while the golden moments
slipped by. As soon as he showed signs of flagging,
Linklater, seeing that it still wanted eight
minutes to the hour, repeated&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"But what <i>does</i> it mean, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mean, you insufferable dolt! It means&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span>
means&mdash;er, 'energy,' 'verve,' 'dash'&mdash;yes,
that's it! 'dash'!"</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater held up a respectful hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I said 'dash!' sir, the moment the question
passed me," he remarked meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">The form roared, and unanimously decided
afterwards that "Link was one up on Braddy."
Mr. Bradshaw, after the manner of his kind,
reported Linklater to the Head for "gross impertinence."
The Head, who had not reached
his present high position for nothing, took a
lenient view of the case, merely requesting Linklater
to refrain in future from humour during
school hours. But for all that Linklater determined
to be "even with Braddy" for reporting
him: and so successful was he in his enterprise
that he effectually destroyed his own last chance
of leading a Grandwich Eleven to Lord's.</p>

<p class="indent">The schoolboy is an observant animal. Mr.
Bradshaw, like most men who carry method and
precision to extremes, was a mass of little affectations
and mannerisms, one of the most curious
of which was his habit of passing his right hand
in one comprehensive sweep along his bald head
and down over his face. The boys knew this
trick by heart: Braddy was much addicted to it
at moments of mental exaltation,&mdash;say, when
standing over a victim and thinking out the details
of some exceptionally galling punishment.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>
Milford tertius, the licensed jester of the Lower
Fourth, had indeed been caned by the Head for
a lifelike imitation of the same, rendered to a
delighted pewful of worshippers during a particularly
dull sermon in chapel.</p>

<p class="indent">The schoolboy, as we have said, is an observant
animal. Very well, then.</p>

<p class="indent">One morning Mr. Bradshaw, as he entered his
classroom, majestic in cap and gown, closing the
door carefully and lovingly behind him, with all
the cheerful deliberation of a Chief Tormentor
who proposes to spend a merry morning in the
torture-chamber, suddenly beheld Linklater stand
up in his place and heave a "Liddell &amp; Scott"
(medium size) across the room at an unsuspecting
youth in spectacles, who was busily engaged
in putting the finishing touches to a copy of
Greek Iambics.</p>

<p class="indent">The book, having reached its destination, rebounded
in obedience to one of the primary laws
of mechanics, and fell with a heavy thud upon
the floor. The form, after the first startled flutter,
settled down with a happy sigh to witness the
rare spectacle of a volcano in full eruption.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bradshaw's eye sparkled. Assuredly the
enemy was delivered into his hand this time.
Mounting his rostrum, he stood gazing, almost
affectionately, upon the perpetrator of the outrage,
mentally passing in review all the possibilities
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;115]</span>
of punishment, from expulsion downwards,
and busily caressing his countenance the while.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently some one in the form tittered. Then
another, and another, and another. Then the
whole room broke into a roar. Mr. Bradshaw,
in high good-humour, allowed them to continue
for some time: he wanted to rub it into Linklater.
At last he cleared his throat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your friends may well smile, sir," he began
majestically. (Cheers and laughter.) "So serene
are you in your conceit and self-assurance that
you proceed to break rules, to behave like a
board-school boy, without even taking the trouble
to observe if one in Authority"&mdash;he smacked
his lips&mdash;"be present or no. What is the result?
Pride has a fall, my young friend. You make a
spectacle of yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Here the speaker was interrupted by a perfect
tornado of merriment. A master can always
raise a snigger at the expense of a boy, but such
whole-hearted appreciation as this had not
fallen to Mr. Bradshaw's lot before.</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;a ludicrous exhibition," he continued, after
the noise had subsided.</p>

<p class="indent">Cheers and laughter, as before.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you could only see yourself now, my boy,
only behold the spectacle you present&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">This time his audience became so hysterical
that Braddy was conscious of an uneasy suspicion
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span>
that something must be wrong. Suddenly
his eye fell upon the pad of foolscap before him,
upon which he had been emphasising his remarks
by vigorous slappings. The paper was covered
with numerous impressions of his hand, neatly
outlined in some jet-black substance. After a
hasty inspection of the hand itself the awful
truth began to dawn upon him, and the now
frenzied Lower Sixth were regaled with the
spectacle of a man attempting to scrutinise his
own countenance by squinting along his nose.</p>

<p class="indent">It must have been about this time, according
to the best authorities, that the Head came in.
That benevolent despot, passing the door on his
way to his study, had been attracted by the
sounds of mirth within; and under the impression
that owing to some misunderstanding Mr.
Bradshaw was not taking his form that hour, he
entered the room to maintain discipline until the
errant master could be found. After his usual
punctilious knock&mdash;he was a head master of the
velvet glove type&mdash;he opened the door, and
stood an interested and astonished spectator of
the scene within.</p>

<p class="indent">What he saw was this&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">On the benches rolled thirty boys, helpless,
speechless, tearful with laughter; and upon the
rostrum, with a parti-coloured bald head and a
coal-black face, there mowed and gibbered a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
creature, which rolled frenzied eyes and gnashed
unnaturally whitened teeth in impotent frenzy
upon the convulsed throng before him.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater had covered the door-handle with
lampblack, and Mr. Bradshaw's favourite mannerism
had done the rest.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">Linklater's escapade took place at the end of
the Christmas term. Early in the following
January the Cricket Committee held their customary
meeting in the President's study, to elect
a Captain and Secretary of the School Eleven for
the following summer term.</p>

<p class="indent">Usually such functions were of the most formal
character. The senior "old colour" was elected
Captain, and the next man Secretary; the Reverend
William Mortimer was unanimously re-elected
President (with an ungrammatical vote
of thanks for past services thrown in); and the
proceedings terminated.</p>

<p class="indent">But this term matters were not so simple.
There were five old colours available: Pip,
sturdy, popular, just eighteen, the best bowler,
according to that infallible oracle the ground-man,
that the school had known in a generation;
Linklater, a beautiful bat and a brilliant field,
with the added recommendation of a century
against the County last summer; Ellis, a steady
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;118]</span>
bat and a good change bowler, a singularly right-minded
and conscientious boy, and therefore
slightly unpopular; Fagg, a wicket-keeper pure
and simple; and Jarvis, a stripling of considerably
more promise than performance, who had
scraped into the Eleven at the end of the summer
term on the strength of a brilliant but fluky
innings against the Authentics.</p>

<p class="indent">Of these five, Pip, from every conceivable
point of view save one, was the obvious and
natural man for the post. But the captaincy of
the Eleven carried with it a School Monitorship,
and the Law, as represented by an inflexible head
master's decree, said that no member of the
school could wear a Monitor's cap who was not
a member of the Sixth. Now, Pip was only a
member of the Fifth, and occupied but a sedimentary
position in that. Consequently the
Committee heaved a resigned if dissatisfied
sigh when Uncle Bill, after taking the chair, announced
with real regret that Wilmot&mdash;this, you
may possibly remember, was Pip's name&mdash;was
not eligible for the post of Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lucky thing Link got his remove this term,"
whispered Fagg to Jarvis, "or he'd have been
barred too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dry up," said Jarvis, with a warning nudge;
"Uncle Bill has got something on his chest."</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Bill indeed appeared to be labouring
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;119]</span>
under some embarrassment, for his good-humoured
face was clouded, and he hesitated before
continuing his remarks.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have another message from the Head," he
said at length. "I will give it you exactly as I
received it, without comment. It is not a pleasant
message, but you&mdash;we have no choice but to obey
orders. It is this. The next in seniority,
Linklater, is a member of the Sixth, and therefore
eligible for office; but on account of his&mdash;of
a regrettable incident in connection with Mr.
Bradshaw last term, the Head feels unable to
make him a Monitor, and consequently he cannot
be Captain of the Eleven."</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Bill had created a sensation this time.
There was a startled stir all round the table,
and one or two glanced stealthily in the direction
of Linklater. He was deathly pale. He
was an ambitious boy,&mdash;as he was an ambitious
man in after life,&mdash;and the snub hurt his pride
more than most of them suspected. The fact
that a far better man than himself had been
passed over, too, did not occur to him. He was
not that sort.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is not an agreeable message to have
to deliver," continued Uncle Bill, who felt the
necessity of breaking the silence. "But whatever
our private feelings in the matter may be,"&mdash;Uncle
Bill did not like Mr. Bradshaw, and he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;120]</span>
was inwardly raging at the calamity which had
befallen his beloved Eleven,&mdash;"we have no
choice in the matter but to obey orders and&mdash;er&mdash;pull
together for the good of the school. We
have still to elect a Captain."</p>

<p class="indent">"I should like to propose Ellis," said Pip at
once.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ellis is proposed. Will somebody second?"</p>

<p class="indent">All eyes were turned upon Linklater, but that
modern Achilles was too mortified to respond to
their mute inquiry. Accordingly, after an awkward
little pause, Ellis was seconded by Mr.
Hanbury, who was present in his capacity of
Treasurer, and unanimously elected. Pip was
appointed Secretary.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry for Ellis," remarked Hanbury to
his colleague as they sat down for a pipe after
the meeting. "It's a poor business giving orders
to two infinitely better players than yourself,
especially when they enjoy the advantage of
being martyrs into the bargain."</p>

<p class="indent">"If I wasn't a parson I should call the whole
thing d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense," remarked Uncle Bill
with sudden heat. He had fathered the School
Eleven for fourteen years, and he was now very
sore that this disaster should have fallen upon the
most promising side he had ever coached. "I
don't want that young ass Linklater particularly,
although they'd have followed him all right; but,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
as I said to the Head, here was a splendid opportunity
for making an exception to the rule about
not appointing a Fifth-Form fellow. If there had
been a decent alternative to Pip I should have
said nothing. Ellis is not popular with the school
as it is, and the fact of his having supplanted
two favourites will make his position simply unendurable.
Poor chap! For sheer moral worth
I don't suppose there are half a dozen boys in the
school to compare with him. But after all he's
only a plodder. He has no more influence than&mdash;than
Bradshaw himself. The Eleven won't
follow him: they think he is 'pi.' He'll stick to
his guns, but he'll be miserable all the time,
and he'll look it too, and altogether he'll cast a
blight over the best Eleven I have ever seen at
Grandwich."</p>

<p class="indent">Hanbury, who knew that his senior would feel
better if allowed to have his say, smoked on.
Presently he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you are rather reckoning without our
friend Pip. He hasn't an ounce of jealousy or
meanness in his composition. Linklater will behave
like the young sweep that he is, but Pip will
back Ellis through thick and thin. Just you see
if he don't. Cheer up, old man, and we trample
on the County and St. Dunstan's yet!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The school had already regretfully resigned
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
themselves to the prospect of not having Pip as
Captain of the Eleven, but the news that Linklater
had been barred too created a storm that
was not allayed for some weeks. Linklater,
much to his own gratification, found himself a
hero, and without ado collected around him a
band of sympathisers of the baser sort, who
assured him twenty times a day that he was
the only "sportsman"&mdash;overworked word!&mdash;in
the school, and asserted with the unreasoning
logic of their kind that things ought to be "made
warm" for Ellis when the summer term arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip said nothing about the matter at all. It
was a way he had. He methodically made up his
fixture card for the cricket season, and remarked
to Ellis that if the present extraordinarily mild
winter ended as it had begun, they ought to be
able with any luck to get up a little net practice
during the fag-end of the spring term after the
Sports.</p>

<p class="indent">But all thoughts of cricket, and indeed of
every other suggestion of summer, were speedily
brought to an end by the coming of the great and
historic frost&mdash;subsequently known as the Hot-Water
Frost&mdash;which is talked about in Grandwich
to this day. It arrived rather late,&mdash;the
first week in February,&mdash;and it held continuously
and unrelentingly until the last week in
March.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
Morning after morning the mercury in the
thermometer outside Big School was found to
have retreated unostentatiously into its bulb;
day after day a watery and apologetic sun shone
forth upon a curiously resonant and rigid world;
and night after night the black frost came down
like a cast-iron pall, repairing in a moment
the feeble and ineffective ravages of the winter
day.</p>

<p class="indent">Not very far away enthusiastic persons were
endeavouring to roast an ox whole in the middle
of the Thames, and at Grandwich many an
equally unusual and delightful pastime was improvised.
There was much sliding: there was no
other way of getting about; and boys and masters
slid or glid, with more or less agility and immunity
from disaster, to and fro between house and
school for several weeks. There was a magnificent
slide, slightly downhill, all the way from Big
School door to the Gymnasium, which offered an
exhilarating rush through the air of nearly seventy
yards&mdash;an offer of which Mr. Bradshaw,
accidentally discovering the existence of the
slide when walking home from dinner one dark
night, involuntarily availed himself.</p>

<p class="indent">There was skating galore, for the Head, taking
it for granted that each day's frost must be
the last, gave extra half-holidays with a liberality
which continued, perforce, for seven weeks.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
There was tobogganing, too, down a smooth hillside
ending in a plantation of young trees, against
which the adamantine heads of the youth of
Grandwich crashed unceasingly from dinnertime
till tea. Every night, between "prep" and
prayers, a picked band from the Hivites house,
which stood adjacent to the slope, sallied out,
often headed by their house-master in person,
carrying pots and kettles filled with hot water
to pour upon the worn parts of the toboggan-slide;
rags and sacking, too, wherewith to bandage
the trunks of such of the young trees as were
beginning to suffer from unceasing collision with
the heads of youthful Grandwich. Under this
scientific treatment the toboggan-slide increased
rather than decreased in excellence. The long
slope, though slightly abraded towards the end
of a day, always emerged glossy and speckless
with the morning's light, and fearsome was the
speed with which the toboggans rushed down to
arboreal destruction at the foot. "Monkey"
Merton, the most agile boy in the school, used to
shoot down on skates, saving his life with incredible
regularity at the end of each descent by
hooking on to a tree as a street arab hooks on to
a lamp-post.</p>

<p class="indent">And if there were joys outside there were
others within. The classrooms were so cold that
the benches were deserted, and boys and master
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
sat round the great open fireplace in a sociable
semicircle. In the houses too, there were unlimited
fires; and unlimited fires meant unlimited
other things. There was a fireplace at the end of
each of the big dormitories, and fires now blazed
in these from seven o'clock every evening. Theoretically
these dormitory fires, not being stoked
after 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, died a natural death shortly after
the boys had retired to bed. In practice, however,
they glowed like the altars of Vesta all
night long, for every boy made it his business to
convey a regular contribution of coal to his dormitory.
(Handkerchiefs were an appalling item
in the laundry-bill that term.) Their united efforts
were thus sufficient to keep the fire going
all night, and the <i>√©lite</i> of the dormitory used to
bivouac round it, in baths filled with bedclothes.
This practice, of course, varied in its extent, and
depended entirely on the house-master's capacity
for keeping his house in order. Among the
Hivites it is sufficient to say that the nocturnal
fire-worshippers were never once disturbed during
the whole seven weeks of frost.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides fuel, it was only natural that light
refreshments should find their way up to the
dormitories, and many and festive were the
supper-parties which were held, with the senior
monitor in the chair&mdash;or rather the bath-chair&mdash;supported
by the nobility and gentry sitting
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
well into the fire, while the fags sat and munched
upon their hat-boxes in the outer circle.</p>

<p class="indent">A change of routine always tugs at the bonds
of discipline; for a boy, like his noble and infinitely
more useful fellow-creature, the horse,
though you may drive him daily with ease and
comfort so long as you do so under monotonously
normal conditions, kicks over the traces at once
if you change his oats or take his blinkers off.
Pip's house, the Hivites, had recently changed
hands. "Uncle Bill" had been promoted to the
largest house in Grandwich, and had left his
flock lamenting, taking Hanbury with him; and
the house, under the benevolent sway of his
successor, Mr. Chilford, a fine scholar but no
master of men, was in that state of discipline
usually described as "lax." Mr. Chilford, who
disliked boys, and saw as little of them as possible,
left a good deal of the management of
his house to monitors&mdash;a sound plan, provided,
firstly, that it is adopted by the house-master
to give his monitors experience and reliability,
and not to save himself trouble; and secondly,
that the monitors have the right stuff in them.
But when the monitors' excessive authority is
entirely due to the house-master's lack of the
same, things are bound to happen.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, Mr. Chilford's monitors that term were
not a very strong lot. They were chiefly of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;127]</span>
clever and rather undersized type, with an unwholesome
respect for the burly malefactors of
the Fifth and Modern Side. Their ranks had
recently been stiffened by the inclusion of Pip,&mdash;non-membership
of the Sixth was no bar to a
house-monitorship,&mdash;and he and Linklater were
the only representatives of authority for whom
the house could be said to have any respect
whatsoever. Pip, as junior monitor, did not
participate largely in the direction of affairs,
but he backed the house's nominal head, one
Maxwell, with a good deal of unostentatious
energy whenever that incompetent official could
be cajoled or reviled into doing his duty; and
he kept a quiet but effective hand upon the
house-bullies.</p>

<p class="indent">But, as has been the case ever since history
grew old enough to repeat itself, the chief
danger came not from without but within.
Linklater, second only to Pip in popularity and
influence, once deposed from the captaincy of
the Eleven, became, as Ham had predicted, the
prey of the parasite and the flatterer. Such,
little though they cared for their much vaunted
hero-martyr, were delighted with any policy
which presented them with an opportunity of
pursuing a career of misdemeanour under monitorial
authority. Did Pip go to quell a riot in
a study, Linklater was in the midst of it; was a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;128]</span>
boy of the baser sort detected in any particularly
unlawful offence, he said that "Linklater had
given him leave."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip bore it all patiently, while he thought the
matter over. Linklater was his friend, the one
boy in Grandwich for whom he felt any real
affection. He had an intense admiration for
Linklater's superb brilliancy in many departments
of school life, and especially for the readiness
and vivacity that he himself lacked. They
had fought their way up the school together, and
had stood back to back in more than one tight
place. The fact that "Link" was at present
completely "off his rocker" was entirely due to
the scurvy manner in which he had been treated
by the Head&mdash;or rather by Braddy; for the
Head, Pip admitted, was bound to back weak
masters up. Link would inevitably recover his
balance in time: at present allowances must be
made for him.</p>

<p class="indent">However, there is a limit to all things. One
evening, after the frost had lasted for nearly a
month, the monitors were lingering over the
tea-table in their own private apartment. A
half-holiday for skating had been granted that
day, and the monitors, pleasantly replete, reclined
round the greatly lightened board, unwilling
to drag themselves away from the <i>d√©bris</i>
of a fine veal-and-ham pie which somebody's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;129]</span>
"people" had kindly sent for somebody's birthday.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the door was opened with a rapid,
nervous flourish, and the Reverend James Chilford
appeared on the threshold. It was plain
that he was suffering from an attack of energy.
For days he would leave his house to its own
devices, and then, suddenly goaded to a sense of
duty by some slight misdemeanour, would make
a lightning descent upon his pupils, and, having
thoroughly punished the wrong boy, disappear
as suddenly as he came.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maxwell!" he exclaimed, in his high, querulous
voice, to the head boy, "are you <i>quite</i>
incapable of maintaining discipline in the house?
Here I have a letter from the parents of Butler,
complaining that their son is being shamefully
and systematically bullied by an organised gang.
I look to you to clear the matter up immediately.
Come and report to me at nine o'clock that you
have detected the offenders and soundly punished
them!"</p>

<p class="indent">The door banged, and this paragon among
house-masters was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Maxwell looked round feebly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what are we to do, you chaps?" he
inquired, seeking to shift responsibility in his
turn.</p>

<p class="indent">"What's the good of doing anything for a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
swine who doesn't knock at the door when he
comes in?" grunted Blakely, the second monitor.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose we'd better have Butler in and
ask him," said Maxwell, forced to take the initiative.</p>

<p class="indent">"Fat lot of good that would do," put in Pip.
"He wouldn't dare to tell you even if he <i>has</i>
been bullied, which I doubt."</p>

<p class="indent">"Better send for Kelly and Hicks," said
somebody.</p>

<p class="indent">Maxwell grew red, and there was a general
laugh, for it was known that he was desperately
afraid of Kelly and Hicks, two bulky and muscular
libertines who did pretty well what they
liked in the house.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not Kelly or Hicks this time," said Pip,
getting up and going to the door, "I'm pretty
sure of that."</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you know?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Had my eye on them all the time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" The other monitors sighed rather enviously.
Their chief object in life was not to
keep their eye on Kelly and Hicks, but to keep
the eye of those freebooters off themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where are you going? Don't clear out till
we have settled something," said Maxwell helplessly,
as Pip turned the door-handle.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right!" said Pip, and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
He turned down a passage towards a district
known as "the Colony," where the boys' studies
were situated. He was not on the track of Kelly
and Hicks this time. Another idea had occurred
to him&mdash;an idea which set the seal of certainty
on a series of conjectures which had been forcing
themselves upon his reluctant mind for some
weeks. After a brief sojourn in a study <i>en route</i>&mdash;usually
known as "the Pub," from the fact that
it was always full&mdash;into which he was unanimously
haled to decide an acrid dispute over
certain questions connected with the Outside
Edge, he steered a course for Linklater's apartment,
which was situated somewhat remotely
at the end of the passage. Linklater, by the
way, had left tea some time before Mr. Chilford's
angry visit.</p>

<p class="indent">He gave his usual heavy thump on the door,
and walked in.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater was at home. He sat in an armchair
with his back to the door. In his hand he
held a red-hot poker, the end of which swayed
gently backwards and forwards not more than
two inches from the paralysed countenance of
Master Butler, who, cut off from retreat by an
intervening table, and rigid with terror, was
staring helplessly at the glowing point with the
thoroughness of a fascinated rabbit.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="indent">Hearing the door open, Linklater looked round.
Almost simultaneously a brown and muscular
hand reached over his right shoulder and whipped
the poker from his grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">"You can clear out, Butler," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Master Butler departed like a panic-stricken
rocket, and Pip and Linklater were left alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater eyed his friend furtively, with an
uneasy grin. He knew that he had to deal with
a boy who was his superior in every way, and
the fact that the boy was his best friend did not
make the coming interview appear any less unpleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip sat down and used the poker, which he
still held in his hand, to burn elaborate holes in
his host's mantelpiece. At length he remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Link, old man, you are making a bally ass of
yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks!" said Linklater laconically.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are putting me in an awful hole over it,
too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Indeed? Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, this sort of thing has got to stop, and
I don't quite know how to set about it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it absolutely necessary for you to try?
Are you head of the house?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I'm not. But Maxwell is. He's a rabbit,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
and the next four are rabbits, too. That
leaves you and me. By rights you ought to be
the man to keep the house on its legs. But you
seem rather inclined to&mdash;to leave it to me. See?"</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater glared.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a large order for one monitor," continued
Pip, "but I'm going to do it, my son."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip finished a rather ornate pattern on the
mantelpiece, laid down the poker, and continued
talking, looking straight into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">"What sort of state do you think the house
will be in by the end of the term if it's to be run
by Kelly, Hicks, and&mdash;you in your present
state? Rotten! I've seen that sort of thing before.
Kendall's house went just the same way
four years ago, and&mdash;look at it now! <i>We</i> aren't
going that way if I can help it. If only you'll
pull yourself together&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What the blazes do you mean?" broke out
Linklater passionately. "Do you think I'm going
to stop taking it out of an idle little hog of
a fag just to please you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Butler? I wasn't talking about him,"
said Pip. "Listen a minute. Lately I've been
able to get no good out of you at all, and you
don't seem to have had much use for me either.
It's not my business to jaw, but I think you
have rather allowed yourself to be talked over
by a pretty rotten lot&mdash;sorry, if they're friends
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
of yours!&mdash;and the result, to be quite frank, is
that you are simply playing Hades with the
house."</p>

<p class="indent">"What have I done?" snapped Linklater.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, the monitors are a weak enough gang
in all conscience, and it takes them all their time
to run things as it is; but when they find you
in the middle of every riot and row they're told
to suppress, I don't wonder that they all go
about looking as if they wanted to blub. Then,
one night last week in the dormitory I woke
up&mdash;about two in the morning, I think&mdash;when
you were still sitting with some of your
pals round the fire. As far as I remember there
were you and Hicks and Kelly and little Redgrave&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You ought to set up as a private detective,"
said Linklater, in tones which were meant to be
sarcastic, but which only succeeded in sounding
rather frightened.</p>

<p class="indent">"I happen to know," said Pip, "because you
were talking rather loud&mdash;at the top of your
voices, in fact. And to judge by your conversation
you were brewing whiskey-punch."</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped, and looked at his friend inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder you didn't rush and tell Chilly,"
said Linklater witheringly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I might have done," agreed Pip, "only it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
happens to be rather a serious matter for a monitor
to be nabbed in a business like that."</p>

<p class="indent">"So you thought you'd give me a pi-jaw
instead! That was decent of you."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip took this affront quite impassively.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't talk rot," he said. "You know perfectly
well that this isn't a pi-jaw. They're not
in my line. We&mdash;we are both people of the same
sort of character. The only difference is that
at present you happen to be rather off your oats
owing to the Head's treatment of you, and that
fills you with a desire to raise Cain and drink
punch in the dormitory&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">This exceedingly handsome way of putting
things appealed even to Linklater's selfish soul.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, perhaps you are right," he growled.
"But why can't you be a sportsman and join in?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder how many good chaps have gone
to the devil through fear of not being thought
'sportsmen,'" he said. "No, Link, old man,
I won't join in. I have my vices, but whiskey-punch
in tooth-mugs at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> isn't one of them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said Linklater ungraciously.
"Sorry to have disturbed your slumbers. I'll
tell the chaps to meet in the East Dormitory tonight.
Sure Maxwell will be pleased to see us!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip stood up and sighed heavily. He knew he
was dealing what would probably be its deathblow
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
to one of the few friendships he really
valued, but this was no time for ignoble compromises.
He leaned rather dejectedly against
the mantelpiece, this David, and looked down
upon the unworthy Jonathan before him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Link, the whole business has got to be
dropped&mdash;absolutely. Surely you've got the
sense to see that."</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke almost appealingly, still clutching
at the fast receding hope that his friend would
pull himself together yet. But he saw in a
moment that the hope was a vain one. Linklater's
teeth shut with a snap, and his eyes
blazed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Drop it, must I? Indeed? And who is going
to stop me? You, I suppose, you&mdash;you
swab!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip put his last regrets from him, and answered
briskly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Correct!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because&mdash;well, because I happen to be rather
fond of this old house,&mdash;we've both had a good
time in it, Link,&mdash;and I don't want to see it
turned into a fully-licensed pub. Also, because
I don't like to see my friends make asses of themselves.
Also, because&mdash;I suppose I ought to
have mentioned this first&mdash;because it happens
to be what I was made a monitor for."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;137]</span>
"O lor!" said Linklater, turning up his eyes;
"talking about his 'duty' now. We shall have
a prayer next!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, horrid word, 'duty,' isn't it?" said Pip.
"I know no sportsman would ever use it. But
I'm going to do mine for all that, my lad."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I venture to inquire how?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, there you rather have me. But I shall
begin by going round the house with a stick and
making myself deuced unpleasant."</p>

<p class="indent">"How the house will love you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"They'll thank me in the end," said Pip
stoutly.</p>

<p class="indent">"What else will you do?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if I can't stiffen up the other monitors
enough to get things right again, I shall have
to make Maxwell report some of the worst people
to Chilly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Maxwell? He'd never dare."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I'll do it myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go and blab! That's right. Great Scott!
you must have got religious mania, or something."</p>

<p class="indent">"But of course," said Pip reassuringly, "I
should only do that as a last resource. I should
try the other way first. To begin with&mdash;but,
by the bye, where do you get your whiskey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What the devil has that got to do with you?"
roared Linklater.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span>
"Lots. I'm going to cut off the supply."</p>

<p class="indent">"Find out where it comes from first."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm going to. Do you get it from the butler?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Find out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right-o! But if I accuse him of supplying
smuggled whiskey to the house, and he happens
to be innocent, it's possible he may consider it
his duty to mention the matter to Chilly. Won't
you be rather landed if he does?"</p>

<p class="indent">He gazed inquiringly at Linklater, and the
latter, thus suddenly cornered, lowered his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"It isn't the butler," he growled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">A pause. Then&mdash;"Atkins." (Atkins was the
gate porter.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks," said Pip. "I'll tell Atkins that if
he supplies another bottle I'll report him to the
Head. But all that is by the way. What I want
to say is this, Link: will you promise me on your
honor to drop all this monkey-business and back
me up in putting the house in decent order
again? This long frost is playing Old Harry
with the place; but if you&mdash;if we play the man
this day, the bottom will drop out of the opposition
completely. Will you promise, Link?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was extremely red in the face. One cannot
strain the foundations of an ancient friendship
without feeling it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
Linklater looked at him for a moment, and
then gazed into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">"Supposing I don't," he said at length.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you will?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; but supposing I <i>don't</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then," said Pip deliberately, "I should have
to give you a thundering good licking, Link."</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater was no coward, but Pip's slow words
dropped into his heart like ice. He felt miserably
petty and mean, and he knew that he looked
it. He raised the ghost of a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wha&mdash;what the blazes do you mean, old
man?" he queried uneasily. "Rum way to
treat your friends, isn't it?" It was the first
time that he had admitted their friendship during
that interview.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, filthy," said Pip. "But there's only
one alternative&mdash;to report you to Chilly, and
I don't want to do that. The less masters have
to do with this job the better."</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater plucked up courage. Pip seemed so
good-tempered and serene.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, old chap," he said easily, "I absolutely
refuse to fight you. The idea's absurd. So there!"</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned back in his chair with the air of a
man who has neatly turned an awkward corner.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip looked at him grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn't say fight," he explained. "I said I
should have to give you a licking,&mdash;an ordinary,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
low-down caning, that is,&mdash;a monitor's
lamming,&mdash;in here. Of course, if you resist, I
shall have to knock you down till you give in;
and then I&mdash;I shall bend you over in the usual
way, that's all."</p>

<p class="indent">He did not speak boastfully, but quietly and
evenly, with his serious blue eyes fixed upon the
boy in front of him. He had figured out the
situation, and settled on his course of action.
To him Linklater had ceased to be a friend, and
was now an abstract problem, to be solved at
all costs. He was prepared to knock Linklater
senseless, if necessary, until he purged him of
the evil spirit that possessed him. And Linklater
knew it.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause, and then Linklater's weaker
nature suddenly crumpled up like a wet rag
before Pip's overbearing steadiness.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right!" he replied petulantly. "Anything
you like. You've beaten me! I'll give in, curse
you! And for Heaven's sake stop staring at me
like that!"</p>

<p class="indent">His overstrained nerves could endure no more,
and he rushed from the study, leaving his guest
master of the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip sighed heavily, and diverted his devastating
gaze into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">He had lost a friend, but he had saved the
house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;141]</span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="indent">Thereafter there was no more trouble with
the unruly element. Bereft of pseudo-monitorial
support, Messrs. Hicks and Kelly found the
ground slipping from under them. They were
routed on several occasions, for Pip exercised
a good deal of quite unconstitutional authority,
and wielded the rod in a manner which they
regarded as excessively unfair. The half-hearted
monitors took courage; presently the house began
to understand the meaning of the word
obedience, and its self-appointed leaders came
to the reluctant conclusion that the game was
not worth the candle. To crown all, the frost
broke, and the long-deferred joys of football
soon dissipated the last relics of discontent and
insubordination for everybody.</p>

<p class="indent">For everybody but Linklater, that is. His
pride had had a fall, and he was not the boy to
recover easily from such a disaster. His interview
with Pip had been absolutely private&mdash;apart
from the momentary intrusion of Pip
upon the torture of Master Butler, a scene which
had lost none of its dramatic force from that
infant martyr's description of it; but the house,
though they knew nothing for certain, observed
two things&mdash;(<i>a</i>) that Linklater was no longer
the sworn foe of law and order, and (<i>b</i>) that he
was no longer the friend of Pip; and putting two
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
and two together and adding them up in time-honoured
fashion to a total of five, they came to
the unanimous and joyous conclusion that Pip
had "lammed Link till he promised to dry up."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, if he felt any satisfaction over the result
of his labours, displayed none. He invited Linklater
to take supper in his study the following
Sunday evening, and though little surprised at
the answer he received, all his stolid philosophy
could not prevent him from feeling distinctly
unhappy.</p>

<p class="indent">One night he lay awake, thinking. The school
clock had just chimed midnight, and the dormitory
was given up to a well-modulated <i>concerto</i>
for seventeen nasal organs. Pip found himself
wondering if Linklater was asleep. Happy
thought! he would go and see.</p>

<p class="indent">The night was cold, and the moon shone
brightly through the uncurtained oriel windows
upon Pip's bare feet as they paddled along the
boarded floor. Pip's cubicle was next to the dormitory
door, while Linklater's was at the extreme
end, the two monitors thus dividing the dormitory
between them.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip had something to say to Linklater.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he arrived at his friend's cubicle.
It possessed no door, and the moonlight illuminated
the interior quite plainly, in spite of
the fact that the lower half of the window was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;143]</span>
obscured by a human form&mdash;the form, in fact,
of the owner of the cubicle. He was leaning far
out, and was apparently endeavouring to communicate
with some one in the garden below.</p>

<p class="indent">No; he was hauling something up! Pip could
see the regular motion of his elbow as the line
came in hand over hand. What had this midnight
fisherman hooked? And who had put the
fish on the hook for him? And what on earth&mdash;?</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the motion of Linklater's elbow
ceased. Still intent on his employment, he
stepped back a pace and scientifically "landed"
his quarry. Simultaneously Pip realised that
this performance was not intended for the public
eye. He must either take official notice of it or
go back to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">He went back to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder," he said to himself, as he settled
down under the clothes again, "if they ever
wrap up anything <i>but</i> bottles in those straw
things? He can't have taken to drink! Atkins,
of course, daren't supply him with any more, so
he must be&mdash;But surely he doesn't find it as
necessary as all that! Perhaps it's only cussedness.
Let's hope so! Poor old Link! In the morning
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Here Pip joined the well-modulated <i>concerto</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Pip's sleepy surmises had been more or less
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;144]</span>
correct. It <i>was</i> a bottle, but Linklater had not
taken to drink. It was, as Pip opined, chiefly
"cussedness." Pip, argued Linklater, had suddenly
turned religious, and by a most unwarrantable
parade of muscular Christianity had
compelled him, Linklater, the idol of the school,
to eat humble pie and then efface himself. But
not even Pip should stop his fun. He would show
his independence!</p>

<p class="indent">Hence the bottle of highly inferior whiskey,
obtained at an appalling cost from an individual
known to the boys as the One-Eyed Tout, who
resided in the adjacent village, and whose visits
to the school (events which the vigilance of the
authorities rendered infrequent and furtive) were
invariably for some nefarious purpose. It is
true that Linklater did not like whiskey, though
plenty of hot water and sugar enabled him to
swallow it with a fair show of enjoyment. But
it was forbidden fruit. Few of us, from Eve
downwards, have ever been able to withstand
that temptation, and, as his dormitory parties
had been perforce discontinued, Linklater conceived
the happy notion of giving a "small and
early" in his own study. And on these hospitable
thoughts intent he invited Kelly and Hicks
to "look in" directly after prayers if they wanted
"a little something, hot."</p>

<p class="indent">Kelly and Hicks both nodded knowingly, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
accepted the invitation with much pleasure.
Their sentiments were perfectly genuine. In
the first place, it is gratifying for ordinary house-bullies
to be noticed by a celebrity in the Eleven;
and in the second, it is comforting to feel that in
the event of a collision with the powers that be,
the entire responsibility will fall upon the exalted
shoulders of your host.</p>

<p class="indent">Bedtime at Grandwich lasted from nine-thirty
till ten-fifteen. The school retired to roost in
detachments&mdash;"squeakers" at half-past nine,
Middle School at ten, and the Sixth at a quarter-past.
At that hour the senior boy was supposed
to turn off the gas, and slumber reigned
officially till six-forty-five the following morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The dormitory cubicles, as has already been
mentioned, possessed no doors, and the partitions
were only seven feet high. Each cubicle was
entered by an opening some three feet wide,
across the top of which ran a stout wooden bar.
The bar, originally devised to strengthen the
framework of the doorway, had been used for
generations by Grandwich boys for the performance
of gymnastic exercises. Indeed, it was incumbent
upon every newcomer, after he had been
a member of the school a fortnight, to do six
"press-ups" on his cubicle-bar, under penalty
of continuous and painful assistance (with a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
slipper) from the rest of the dormitory until proficiency
was attained.</p>

<p class="indent">On the evening of Linklater's party, Pip arrived
in the dormitory, as was his custom, shortly
before ten, and after attiring himself in his pyjamas
proceeded to his usual exercises. Five minutes'
club-swinging warmed his blood nicely; and
he had just completed his preliminary "toe-and-up,"
and was sitting balanced on the bar, when
the dormitory door, which adjoined the entrance
to his cubicle, suddenly swung open, and Linklater
appeared upon the threshold. He was
singing, blindly, lustily, raucously; and Pip
realised at a glance that the "straw thing" <i>had</i>
contained a bottle, and that his friend was now
a fully-qualified candidate for "the sack."</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater arrived opposite Pip's cubicle, where
he drew up with a slight lurch and a suggestion
of a hiccup. Small boys, who, attracted by his
corybantic entrance, had come to the doors of
their cubicles to see what the matter was, regarded
him furtively with looks of mingled fear
and amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip slipped off his bar.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you been making that filthy row all
the way up from your study?" he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater turned a slightly glazed eye upon
him, and nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"In that case," said Pip, "you'll probably have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
Chilly up any moment. If he catches you like
this you'll get sacked&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;<i>sacked!</i>
Go to bed, quick&mdash;you swine!"</p>

<p class="indent">He took his bemused friend by the shoulder
and turned him in the right direction. But two
glasses of toddy held firm sway in Linklater's
unaccustomed interior, and for the moment
Dutch courage was the order of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">"Think I care?" he roared. "Where <i>is</i> old
Chilly? Let me get at him! Chilly be&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"There he is!&mdash;downstairs&mdash;now!" hissed
Pip in his ear. "Get to your cubicle and into bed,
as quick as you can. I'll try to keep him down at
my end; but if he comes along to you, pretend
to be asleep. It's your only chance."</p>

<p class="indent">All the time he was hustling the highly indignant
Linklater towards his cubicle. Downstairs
Mr. Chilford's high voice could be heard querulously
announcing its owner's determination to
unearth "the perpetrator of this outrage."</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment it seemed as if Pip's determined
strategy would succeed. But just at the entrance
to his cubicle Linklater broke away with a
sudden twist, and in a moment was flying down
the dormitory again with the avowed intention
of interviewing his house-master.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is the blighter?" he shrieked. "Lead
me to him, and I'll&mdash;Pip, you cad, leave me
alone! Help! rescue! cad&mdash;hrrrumph!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;148]</span>
The last ejaculation was caused by sudden
contact with his own pillow, for Pip, losing all
patience, fairly picked him up in his arms, and,
carrying him kicking and struggling the whole
length of the dormitory, through a double rank
of trembling and ecstatic fags, heaved him
through the doorway of his cubicle on to his
bed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Get him into bed and sit on his head," he
whispered rapidly to the two biggest boys present.
"Chilly is coming upstairs now. Never
mind his clothes. Quick!"</p>

<p class="indent">His lieutenants, though they risked a heavy
punishment for being found in another boy's
cubicle, turned to their task with the utmost
cheerfulness and vigour, while Pip raced down
the dormitory to repel the invader. When that
well-meaning but incompetent pedagogue entered
the door Pip was preening himself upon
his cubicle-bar.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chilford began at once&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Wilmot, what is the meaning of this disgraceful
disturbance? I insist upon having the
names of those responsible. Do you hear? I
insist, I say,&mdash;I insist!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Disturbance, sir?" said Pip blankly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;disturbance, brawl, riot, pandemonium,
boy! Who is responsible?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What sort of disturbance was it, sir?" inquired
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
Pip respectfully, his cast-iron features
unmoved.</p>

<p class="indent">"What sort? Are you deaf? Do you mean
to say you heard nothing?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip reflected.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I did hear somebody singing, sir,"
he admitted at length.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear?" Mr. Chilford almost screamed. "I
should think you did! And, what is more, I
believe he was coming up to this dormitory. Who
was it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think it must be a mistake, sir. There is
nobody singing here; you can hear that for
yourself, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chilford was accustomed to cavalier treatment
from boys, but Pip's bland rudeness was
rather more than even he was prepared to stand.
For a moment there was dead silence in the
dormitory, broken only by spasmodic quakings
from one or two beds. Then, just as Mr. Chilford
braced himself for a thorough scarifying of
Pip,&mdash;a congenial task which would probably
have occupied his mind to the exclusion of all
else and so tided over a disaster,&mdash;there came
from the far end of the dormitory a loud, resonant,
and alcoholic chuckle, and out of the gloomy
recesses of Linklater's cubicle there arose once
more the refrain of that very song which had
brought Mr. Chilford flying from his study.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Pip ground his teeth. But he broke in
quickly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Would you mind telling me if I do a straight-arm
balance right, sir?" (Mr. Chilford had been
something of a gymnast in his youth, and many
a hard-pressed sinner had escaped punishment at
the eleventh hour by asking his advice on the
subject.) "My left arm seems to go wrong somehow.
Do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But Mr. Chilford had heard the noise.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&mdash;I knew it, I knew it!" he cried.
"It <i>is</i> in this dormitory. Who is it, Wilmot? I
insist upon you giving me his name."</p>

<p class="indent">"I expect it's Linklater, sir," said Pip, after
consideration. The dormitory shivered. Surely
Pip was not going to throw up the sponge now!
"He often sings in his sleep, sir," he added.</p>

<p class="indent">The dormitory breathed again, and Mr. Chilford,
completely baffled by Pip's heroic coolness,
paused irresolutely. Meanwhile, in the murky
recesses of Linklater's abiding-place, the two
sturdy Fifth-Form boys did not cease to sit precariously
but resolutely on Linklater's head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where I go wrong, sir," continued Pip, following
up his advantage, "is here." He poised
himself on the bar and began to sink his head
slowly down, while his rigid body and legs,
hinged on his elbows, swung slowly up. "My
left arm begins to go as soon as the weight&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Mr. Chilford began to take an interest, in spite
of himself. But then&mdash;ten thousand horrors!&mdash;there
was a sound as of heavy bodies in conflict,
and Linklater's raucous voice was once more
uplifted&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"What? Here, is he? Just the man I want to
see! Lead me to him, lead me to him, I tell you!
Lead&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Should I have my thumbs round the bar, sir,
or alongside my fingers?" gasped Pip, upside
down and desperate.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was too late. Mr. Chilford, roused at
last, turned on his heel and rushed up the dormitory
in the direction of Linklater's cubicle.</p>

<p class="indent">He had only taken a few steps when his course
was arrested by the sound of a crash and a dull
thud behind him. He whirled round again to see
what had happened. Pip was no longer balanced
on the bar, but lay on the floor beneath, a motionless
heap of arms and legs and striped
pyjamas.</p>

<p class="indent">Providence had stepped in at the eleventh
hour, and the unjust had been saved, not for the
first time, at the expense of the just.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Seven feet is not a very long way to fall, but
when you do so head first, and alight on the
point of your left shoulder on a boarded floor,
something is bound to go. Pip's collar-bone
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
went, and his thick head also suffered considerable
concussion. However, his injuries, as
described to Master Linklater by the entire dormitory
next morning, were sufficient to give that
late disciple of Bacchus a very bad fright indeed.
His recollection of the disaster itself was vague
in the extreme, but the strictures on his own
part in the affair, received from numerous angry
people during the next few days, had an effect
upon him which was to last the rest of his life.
Consequently it was a very remorseful and repentant
Linklater who presented himself at the
Sanatorium two days later, on a visit to the
invalid.</p>

<p class="indent">"Five minutes and no more!" said the decisive
matron, as she showed him into the sick-room.
"His head is still very painful."</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater, to his eternal credit, devoted the
greater part of the five minutes to an abject
apology for his baseness and ingratitude. Pride&mdash;most
invincible of all devils&mdash;was swept
aside at last, and his broken words embarrassed
Pip considerably.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, old man, you can dry up now,"
he remarked nervously, as Linklater paused for
breath. "Let's drop the subject once and for
all. It's all over."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it? Pip, they say you won't be able to
bowl next term."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
This possibility had not occurred to Pip, but
if he felt any disappointment he displayed
none.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," he said, "it's a pity. Never mind!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And it's all my fault, my fault!" Linklater
held his head in his hands and groaned aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your fault? Piffle, my dear man! What on
earth had you to do with my falling off a bar?
You were at the other end of the dormitory.
The whole thing was an accident: it happened
at a rather lucky time for you, that's all. You'd
better cut now."</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater rose to go, mightily comforted.</p>

<p class="indent">"I heard how you held out against Chilly,
trying to keep him from coming&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, hook it!" remarked the patient uneasily.</p>

<p class="indent">But Linklater lingered a moment. He wanted
to say something.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll&mdash;we'll look after the house till you come
back, Pip," he said awkwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Right. Back Maxwell up. He's a puker,
Link."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, so long!"</p>

<p class="indent">"So long!"</p>

<p class="indent">Linklater reached the door, and turned.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a rum world, Pip," he said. "If you
hadn't tumbled off that bar at that precise
moment I should have been sacked."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span>
"You would," assented Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as the door closed upon his friend, he
turned to the wall, and murmured with a contented
chuckle,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"That's why I did it, my son!"</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_6" id="CHAPTER_6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>Petticoat Influence</h3>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Pip</span>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"May I come in?"</p>

<p class="indent">"All right," said Pip in a surprised tone. His
sister was not in the habit of craving admission
to his den in this formal manner.</p>

<p class="indent">The reason revealed itself with the opening of
the door. Pipette entered the room with another
girl, at whose appearance Pip, always deferential
to the point of obsequiousness in female society,
rose up hastily and removed his pipe from his
mouth. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and otherwise
unprepared for company. His private apartment
was in a state of more than usual confusion,
for a difference of opinion had arisen between
John&mdash;the fox-terrier&mdash;and a cricket-boot, and
the one-sided conflict that ensued, together with
the subsequent chastisement of John, had deranged
even the primitive scheme of upholstery
that prevailed in "the pig-sty," as Pip's apartment
was commonly called.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is Elsie Innes," said Pipette. "My
brother."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip saw before him a girl of about sixteen.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
She had extremely fair hair, a clear skin, not
unbecomingly freckled, and eyes which had a
habit of changing from blue to grey in different
lights. Girls of sixteen are not always graceful,&mdash;like
their male prototypes they frequently run
to knees and elbows,&mdash;but this girl appeared to
be free from such defects. She possessed a slim,
lithe, young figure, and carried herself with an
elasticity and freedom that spoke of open air
and early bedtimes. She was in the last stages
of what slangy young men call "flapperdom,"
and her hair was gathered on the nape of her
neck with a big black bow. Pip, of course, did
not take in all these things at once, but he had
time to note especially the neatness of Elsie
Innes's feet and the whiteness of her teeth.
From which it will be observed that, though his
experience in these matters was limited and his
judgment unformed, Pip's instincts were sound.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please sit down," he said, sweeping John
and "The Field" from out of the armchair.
"Pipette, what on earth did you bring Miss&mdash;Miss,
er&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Innes."</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;Miss Innes up to this untidy hole for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The drawing-room has got two plumbers in
it, and they are laying lunch in the dining-room,
and Father is in the study, so we came here," said
Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
Pip expressed his delight rather lamely, and
the girls sat down.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must endure us till lunch," continued
Pipette. "I suppose you know that this is the
day of the Blanes' garden-party?"</p>

<p class="indent">"So it is! I had forgotten."</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette smiled amiably and turned to her
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">"What did I tell you?" she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"You said," replied Miss Innes, "that he
would say he had forgotten all about it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, dear," continued Pipette, pointing an
accusing finger, "don't think you can deceive
<i>us</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?" inquired Pip uneasily.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," said Pipette. "Think."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip thought, apparently with success. "Oh,"
he said, growing red in the face,&mdash;he had never
outgrown that childish weakness,&mdash;"you are a
little ass, Pipette!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette nodded sagely and smiled at Miss
Innes. That young person smiled indulgently
upon Pip, and heaved a little sigh which intimated
that boys would be boys.</p>

<p class="indent">For Pip was at this time involved in the
meshes of his first serious love-affair. Being
without skill in the art of dissimulation, he
made no attempt to conceal his condition, and
in consequence was now acting as target for the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
playful and occasionally rather heavy banter of
his friends. Why, goodness knows! We have
grown so accustomed to regard the youthful lover
as an object of humour, that a young man, if he
happens to fall in love, is now compelled to conceal
the fact, or, at any rate, dress it up, and
endeavour to pass the affair off as at most a
mere airy flirtation.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, roughly speaking, a man is in love from
his fifteenth birthday onwards: nature has ordained
it. But in most cases civilisation, convention,
society&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;has
ordained that he must not treat this, the most
inspiring passion of human life, as anything more
than a jest for another ten years or so. And
therein lie more little tragedies&mdash;disintegrated
castles-in-the-air, secret disappointments, and
endless efforts of self-repression&mdash;than this
world dreams of. The boy may keep the girl's
photograph on his mantelpiece, and that is just
about all he may keep. Contrast with this the
happy case of the girl. If <i>she</i> chooses to fall in
love at the age of eighteen, nothing is deemed
prettier or more natural: she is at liberty to enjoy
her birthright openly; she receives sympathetic
assistance on every hand; and if at the age of
nineteen or twenty she decides to marry, society
comes and sheds rapturous tears at the wedding.
What of the boy who has been her playmate for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
years back; who has taken the lead in all their
childish escapades; who has been her trusted
guardian and confidant ever since they pulled
crackers and kissed under the mistletoe at children's
parties? What of him? He is still a boy.
True, he is a year older than she is, but by an
immutable law he is for all practical purposes
ten years her junior. She has sprung up at a
stroke of some mysterious magician's wand into
a woman, a personage with an acknowledged
position in the scheme of things; and he, her old
sweetheart, is only a poor, broken-hearted hobbledehoy.
He will get over it, you say? Quite
true. But that will not make things any easier
for him at present. Ten years later he will take a
girl away from some other hobbledehoy and
marry her. He will then be in the prime of young
manhood; and he will behold his first love, plump,
matronly, and rather <i>pass√©e</i>, sitting in a back
pew at the wedding. It seems rather a dull sort
of revenge, somehow.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course boy and girl marriages would never
do. Joint inexperience is a sure guarantee of
disaster. Still, sentimental persons may be permitted
one sigh of regret for a millennium which,
however hopelessly idyllic and unpractical it
might be, would at any rate prevent young men
from marrying wealthy widows, and pretty girls
from giving themselves, in exchange for a position
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span>
in society, to middle-aged gentlemen with
five-figure incomes. And if a young man must
spend the best years of his life in repressing his
tenderest instincts, let us at any rate refrain
from laughing at his struggles.</p>

<p class="indent">All of which brings us back to Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">The female sex exercised a more than usual
fascination over him. Brought up in a circle
almost exclusively male,&mdash;Pipette was too completely
subservient to himself to have any direct
influence on the moulding of his character,&mdash;Pip
regarded women in general much as the poor
Indian regards the sun, moon, and other heavenly
bodies,&mdash;as things not to be understood or approached,
but merely to be worshipped. Pip was
a Galahad,&mdash;an extremely reserved, slow-moving,
and, at times, painfully shy Galahad,&mdash;but
a very perfect gentle knight for all that. He
treated all women, from his sister's friends to the
most plebeian young person who ever dispensed
refreshment across a bar, with a grave courtesy
which the more frivolous members of that captious
sex occasionally found rather dull.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a girl was Miss Madeline Carr. Pip had
met her six months before on a visit to the home
of his friend Dick Blane, and, being a healthy
young man and twenty-one, had fallen in love
with her. Being Pip, he did the thing thoroughly,
and made no attempt to conceal his devotion.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
Unfortunately, Madeline was of a type, not uncommon,
which only wants what it cannot get,
and thinks but little of what may be had for
nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">She was an exceedingly pretty girl of twenty,
in her second season, and consequently almost
sufficiently worldly-wise to be Pip's mother.
Having made an absolutely bloodless conquest
of Pip, she valued him accordingly, and Pip
was now beginning to realise that there must
be something wrong with an attachment which
consisted of perpetual devotion on the one side
and nothing but an occasional careless acknowledgment
of services rendered on the other. Of
late, however, the situation had improved.
Madeline had come up to Cambridge for the
May Week, and finding that Pip occupied a position
of authority and even admiration among his
fellows that she had never dreamed of, and of
which she had gathered no hint from Pip's own
references to his 'Varsity life, Miss Carr decided
in her shrewd, business-like, and thoroughly
cold-blooded little heart that, for the time being,
considerable <i>kudos</i> might accrue to her as the
exclusive proprietress of the most popular man
of his year. Consequently for a brief week Pip
had basked in the unaccustomed sunshine of her
smiles; and though there had been a perceptible
lowering of temperature since their return to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
town, he was still about as cheerful as a man in
love has any right to be.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to Miss Innes.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you going to the party?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look at me!" replied his guest. "No, not
at my face,"&mdash;Pip was regarding her resolutely
between the eyes,&mdash;"my clothes. Can't you see
I'm dressed for a party?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" remarked Pip meditatively, shifting
his gaze lower down, "I see. You are coming
with us, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not us," interposed Pipette,&mdash;"you."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! aren't you coming yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. The Lindons are to be here for lunch,
and I must stay and entertain the old lady while
Father and Sir John sit in the study and talk
shop."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bad luck!" replied Pip. "Sir John Lindon
and the dad are always searching about inside
people and finding new diseases," he explained,
turning to Elsie. "It is called Research. I remember
once in the 'lab' at&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"So you must escort Miss Innes, Pip," said
Pipette hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Right! That will be first-rate," said Pip,
with a heartiness which quite surprised himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they went down to lunch, and after
Pip had arrayed himself in tennis costume, the
two set off for the Blanes' garden-party.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;163]</span>
It was the last week in June. Term was over,
and ten places had been filled up in the Cambridge
Eleven against Oxford. Pip so far had
not received his Blue. He had just completed
his first year, for he had not gone direct from
school to the University, partly because his
attainments were not quite up to the standard
of the Previous Examination, and partly because
he had never quite shaken off the effects of his
fall in the dormitory that eventful night two-and-a-half
years ago. A trip round the world
with a tutor had corrected these deficiencies,
and Pip was now at the end of his period of
"Fresherdom" at the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p class="indent">But somehow all was not well with his cricket.
He had been tried against the M.C.C. and had
not been a success. His chief rival, Honeyburn
of Trinity, had been tried against Yorkshire, and
had been a failure. The University captain had
been reduced to experimenting with a lob-bowler,
and such a creature had been tried against an
England Eleven a week before. But though he
had taken two good wickets they had cost forty-four
runs apiece; and his further services had
been dispensed with. So the last place was still
unsettled. Pip, knowing that University captains
very seldom go back to their first loves, had
little hope of being chosen, though he had a
good college record. Most probably the captain,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>
rendered desperate, would fall back on some
well-tried friend of his own on whom he could
rely to a certain, if limited, extent; or else&mdash;horror
of horrors!&mdash;bring up some last year's
Blue, dug out of an office or a public school, and
so blight the last faint pretensions of all those
gentlemen who were still hoping to be chosen,
if only in the humble r√¥le of a <i>pis aller</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now Wednesday, and Cambridge was to
play Oxford at Lord's on the following Monday.
Pip was a phlegmatic youth, but the knowledge
that Cayley, the Cambridge captain, who was
Mrs. Blane's nephew, would probably be at the
garden-party, gave him a vague feeling of unrest.
Perhaps Cayley had not made up his mind
yet; perhaps the proverb about "out of sight out
of mind" was capable of working negatively;
perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you imagine you are entertaining me?"
inquired a cold voice at his side.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip started guiltily. "I had forgotten you
were there," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought you had," said Miss Innes composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip smiled at her in his most friendly and
disarming fashion. "Very rude of me," he continued:
"I'm sorry. The fact is, I never can
think of things to say to people."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not tell me what has been going on
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;165]</span>
in your mind all this time?" suggested the girl.
"That would be something."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, that was only cricket," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought so. You were wondering if you
were going to get your Blue."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip turned and regarded this discerning young
person with increasing interest.</p>

<p class="indent">"How did you guess that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, it was not very difficult. I should be
too, if I were in your place. The papers are
quite full of it. 'The Sportsman' says&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you read 'The Sportsman'?" asked Pip,
much softened.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and of course I read 'The Field' on Saturdays.
Now, tell me what you were twisting
your left wrist about for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Great Scott! Was I?" cried Pip, turning
pink.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; and you were skipping about just like
you do when you run up to the wicket to bowl."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was too perturbed by this information to
notice the compliment implied by Miss Innes's
familiarity with his bowling action.</p>

<p class="indent">"I must have looked an ass," he said apologetically.
"Bad luck on you, too!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I was all right. I walked a yard or two
behind. People didn't know I was with you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" said Pip, rather sheepishly.</p>

<p class="indent">"And as I was watching your action," continued
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;166]</span>
the girl judicially, "I thought of something&mdash;just
as you dodged round that old gentleman
at the corner of Reedham Gardens."</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn't notice him," said Pip humbly.</p>

<p class="indent">"No? Well, he noticed you, I think, because
he stopped and spoke to the policeman at the
corner after he had passed us," said the girl
gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">"I seem to have been going it. But what was
the thing you thought of?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you bowl left-handed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; I know."</p>

<p class="indent">"You run up to the wicket in rather a queer
way, as though you were going to bowl at point,
and then you suddenly swing round the corner
and let the batsman have it instead."</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite right. But where on earth&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't interrupt! I am speaking to you for
your good." The girl was genuinely in earnest
now. "Well, you always bowl over the wicket,
don't you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; why not?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie looked at him severely.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't you see what a grand chance you have
been throwing away all this time?" she said.
"If you bowled <i>round</i> the wicket, you would&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I see, I see!" roared Pip, slapping his leg.
"Confound my thick head! The umpire! If I
bowl over the wicket I'm in full view of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
batsman all the time; but with my diagonal run,
if I bowled <i>round</i> the wicket I should pass behind
the umpire just before delivering the ball, and
so bother the batsman? Is that it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That's it. You should have thought it out
for yourself years ago," said the girl reprovingly.</p>

<p class="indent">The conversation was interrupted by their arrival
at Mrs. Blane's house.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Innes was immediately snapped up to
play tennis, and Pip drifted off in search of the
lady to whom he was wont to refer with mingled
pride and depression as his "best girl." They
greeted each other in their usual manner, the
balance of cordiality being heavily on Pip's side;
and Miss Carr inquired&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Who is your friend&mdash;the school-girl person
in the white frock?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, anxious to clear himself of any appearance
of faithlessness, explained that Miss Innes
was a friend of his sister's, and hastened on his
own part to disclaim anything approaching intimacy
with the lady. He then craved the favour
of a game of croquet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at present," said Miss Carr, who had
just been introduced to a young Guardsman,&mdash;"I'll
see later. But you can go and get me some
strawberries and bring them over to the croquet-lawn."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip departed as bidden; but somehow he was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;168]</span>
not conscious of the glow of heroic devotion
that usually actuated him when obeying Madeline
Carr's behests. He had a feeling that she
might have said "Please!" and a further feeling
that "other people"&mdash;no further specification&mdash;would
have done so at once.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point in his reflections he arrived at
the croquet-lawn with the strawberries, and was
promptly commanded to put them down and
stand by for further orders. This treatment,
customary though it was, annoyed him; and,
feeling unusually independent and assertive, he
drifted behind a rhododendron bush, where he
encountered his crony, Mr. Richard Blane, the
son of the house, who was enjoying a quiet cigarette
during a brief lull in the arduous labour of
dispensing hospitality.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo, Pip!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Cigarette?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks."</p>

<p class="indent">The two smoked silently for a moment, sitting
side by side on the garden-roller.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say," inquired Mr. Blane, "who is that
flapper you brought with you? All right&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Name of Innes," replied Pip shortly. "Scotch&mdash;pal
of Pipette's."</p>

<p class="indent">"Seems to be a pal of Cayley's, too," said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span>
Blane. "They were having a quiet ice in the
shrubbery just now. Very thick, they looked."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is Cayley here, then?" said Pip, looking
more interested.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Has he given you your Blue yet?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bad luck! Well, there are still a few days.
I expect he is waiting to see if the wicket is
going to be hard or soft."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose he hasn't given it to Honeyburn?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't think so."</p>

<p class="indent">"I expect he will," said Pip in resigned tones.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rot! You seem to be fearfully down on your
luck this afternoon, old man. Come and have an
orgy of claret-cup. It's about all we keep to-day."
Mr. Blane rose from the roller, brushing
some blades of grass from his immaculate flannels.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorry&mdash;can't," said Pip. "Miss Carr said
she might be able to play croquet with me about
now," he explained awkwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick knew all about his infatuation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip," said that youthful sage, inclining his
head at a judicial angle, "you drop that girl!
She's the wrong sort."</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here, Dick&mdash;" began Pip indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I know," continued the voice of the
misogynist. "She's perfect and all that; but no
woman is worth the seriousness you are putting
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;170]</span>
into this business. I believe it's spoiling your
eyes, for one thing. Madeline Carr is simply
making use of you. You see how she is behaving
just now&mdash;playing a sort of in-and-out game?
Well, she is waiting to see if you get your Blue.
If you do, she will trot about with you during
the luncheon interval at Lord's, and so on. It'll
make the other girls jealous. If you don't&mdash;well,
she'll have no use for you. Oh, I know 'em!"
The orator wagged his head and paused for
breath.</p>

<p class="indent">To Pip most of this diatribe was rank blasphemy,
but he felt uncomfortably conscious that
there was some truth in his friend's remarks.
Still, he stood up stoutly for his ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't talk rot, Dick!" he said. "There may
be a few women like that,&mdash;just one or two,&mdash;but
this girl isn't one of them. Why, you have
only got to look at her face to see that!"</p>

<p class="indent">The world-weary Blane surveyed his friend
with something approaching consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">"A bad case!" he remarked, shaking his head.
"Her face? My boy, faces are the most deceptive
things in the world."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hers isn't," maintained Pip. "She is most
sincere. You have only to look her in the eyes
to see what is going on inside."</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped suddenly. He realised that he
was growing too communicative.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;171]</span>
"Eyes? That's just it. A girl makes eyes at
you, Pip, and you crumple up. I had no idea
you were in such a drivelling state as this, or I
should have jawed you sooner. Come and drink
stimulants,&mdash;claret-cup, lemonade, iced-coffee,
anything to drown the past,&mdash;but come. And
never again, after this experience, trust a girl
with big eyes and little ways."</p>

<p class="indent">So saying, the counsel for the prosecution took
the counsel for the defence by the arm, and the
two, nobly sinking their differences in a common
cause, cast their cigarettes away and sallied forth
to distribute tea and ices among hungry chaperons
and plain girls.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Miss Elsie Innes and the Cambridge
captain were conversing in a retired part
of the garden. An introduction had been effected
by Miss Blane, though at whose instigation
need not concern us.</p>

<p class="indent">Cayley, whose conversational stock-in-trade
was limited, was feeling unusually complacent.
The conversation had never flagged once, for this
girl, though obviously young and inexperienced,
had proved herself to be intelligent and appreciative
beyond her years.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose you are going to beat Oxford," said
Miss Innes, looking at her companion with innocent
admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is a large question," replied Cayley
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;172]</span>
heavily. "These things aren't settled by the
spin of a coin. But we are going to do our best,"
he added, with an indulgent smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you picked your team yet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"All but one. I want another bowler."</p>

<p class="indent">"I see. What sort of bowler?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A good bowler," replied the captain, facetiously.
It was hardly worth while wasting
technicalities on a girl.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! Can't you find one?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have got three in my eye, but I can only
choose one."</p>

<p class="indent">"I saw the Cambridge Eleven play against
the M.C.C.," said Miss Innes, apparently changing
the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">"Which day?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The second. <i>You</i> made sixty-nine, not out."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cayley, much gratified, coughed confusedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, that was a fluke," he said. "The difficulty
that day was to get wickets."</p>

<p class="indent">"There was one Cambridge bowler," continued
the girl, "who looked as though he ought to take
wickets but didn't."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who was that?" inquired the captain, much
amused.</p>

<p class="indent">"A man with black hair and blue eyes."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cayley scratched his nose reflectively.
His recollections of the eyes of his team were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span>
vague. Their individual shades he had never
observed, though he had frequently condemned
them collectively.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, really&mdash;" he said. "Do you remember
anything else about him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He was a medium-paced, left-handed bowler,
breaking both ways, with a good deal of swerve
as well," said Miss Innes, becoming suddenly
and surprisingly technical: "he had a curious
oblique run, and he usually bowled about one
really fast ball every over."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh&mdash;Pip!" said the captain at once.</p>

<p class="indent">"That is the name," said the girl; "I remember
now, when a catch went to him in the outfield,
you called out, 'Run for it, Pip!'"</p>

<p class="indent">"That's him," said Cayley. "Yes, he has
been disappointing lately. He is a good bowler,
too; but somehow he is not taking wickets at
present."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you ever tried him round the wicket?"
asked Elsie. "With his run he would pass
behind the umpire just before delivering the
ball."</p>

<p class="indent">The captain was fairly startled this time. He
turned and regarded the <i>ing√©nue</i> beside him with
undisguised interest and admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say," he remarked, with the air of one who
has just made a profound discovery, "you know
something about cricket!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>
Miss Innes, much to his surprise, blushed like
a little schoolboy at the compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was brought up to it," she said. "I am a
sister of Raven Innes."</p>

<p class="indent">Then the captain understood; and he almost
fell at her feet, for the name of Raven Innes is
honourably known from Lord's to Melbourne.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you play yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"A bit. I don't bat quite straight, but I can
bowl a little. Leg-breaks," she added, with a
touch of pride.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain's appreciative reverie was interrupted
by the appearance of a third party&mdash;Pip,
to wit&mdash;who now drifted into view and hovered
rather disconsolately in the offing, as if uncertain
whether to approach. He was a prey to
melancholy, having just completed a final rupture
with Madeline Carr, and under the stress of
subsequent reaction was anxious to escape home.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo!" said Cayley. "There's your man,
Miss Innes."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Innes glanced in Pip's direction.</p>

<p class="indent">"So it is. I can recognise him," she answered,
with an air of gratified surprise. "Will you take
me to have some strawberries now, please?"</p>

<p class="indent">The couple departed, leaving Pip still hove-to
on the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rum things, women," mused the captain.
"This girl's quite out of the common. I thought
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
at first she must be keen on Pip, or something;
but she doesn't seem even to know him. Not
often you get a woman taking a purely sporting
interest in a man like that!"</p>

<p class="indent">Which is nothing but the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Delighted to find a woman possessed of "some
sense," Cayley, who was by nature a homely person
with bachelor instincts, unbent still further,
with the result that the end of a long bout of
cricket "shop" with Elsie found him fully convinced&mdash;somewhat
to his surprise, for he had
hitherto been unable to make up his mind on
the subject&mdash;that Pip was exactly the man
he wanted for next Monday.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie finally joined Pip, who was waiting,
slightly depressed, to take her away.</p>

<p class="indent">"Had a good time?" she inquired brightly, as
they walked home.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rotten," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn't you meet any friends?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, a good many 'Varsity men."</p>

<p class="indent">"I meant lady friends."</p>

<p class="indent">"I haven't got any," said Pip glumly.</p>

<p class="indent">"You should speak the truth," said his companion
with some acerbity. "How about Miss
Carr?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip glanced at her; and then, moved by an
impulse which he did not quite understand at the
time, he said, with sudden and unwonted heat,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
"I never wish to set eyes on Miss Carr again."</p>

<p class="indent">After this outburst they walked on silently,
till they came to a house in Sussex Gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">"I live here," said Miss Innes. "Good-bye,
and thank you so much for bringing me home."</p>

<p class="indent">They shook hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"When shall I see you again?" said Pip
regretfully.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl smiled at his frank seriousness.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord's, on Monday," she said. "Come and
see me in the luncheon hour, or before, if Cambridge
is batting."</p>

<p class="indent">"I say," said Pip gruffly, "aren't you rather
taking things for granted?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean your coming to see me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Gracious, no!" cried Pip in genuine distress.
"I meant about my playing."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie Innes looked him straight in the face.
"Pip," she said, "do you wear gloves?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip extended two enormous palms and inspected
them doubtfully. "Sometimes," he said&mdash;"at
weddings."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good. I'll bet you ten pairs of gloves
to one that you get your Blue."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't!" said Pip appealingly. "You couldn't
afford it. I take nines."</p>

<p class="indent">"My size," said Miss Innes, "is six-and-a-quarter.
White kid&mdash;eight buttons. Good-bye!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
She turned and vanished into the recesses of
the hall, a receding vision of white frock, glinting
hair, and black bow.</p>

<p class="indent">After Pip had walked down two streets and
halfway across a square, he stopped suddenly
and dealt his leg a blow with a tennis-racquet
that would have maimed an ordinary limb for
life.</p>

<p class="indent">"By gad," he cried to a scandalised pug-dog
which was taking the evening air on an adjacent
doorstep, "she called me Pip!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Next morning he received a communication
from the authorities of the Cambridge University
Cricket Club.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later he was being shepherded, scarlet
in the face, by a posse of stentorian shopwalkers,
through an embarrassing wilderness of ladies'
hosiery to the Glove Department of an establishment
in Oxford Street.</p>

<h3>A CRICKET WEEK</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">By</span> the time that Pip had reached his twenty-fifth
year his name was scarcely less familiar to
the man in the street than that of the leading
picture-postcard divinity, and considerably more
so than that, say, of the President of the Royal
Academy. The English are a strange race, and
worship strange gods. Pip's admission to the
national Pantheon had been secured by the fact
of his having been mainly responsible for the
sensational dismissal of the Australians, for an
infinitesimal score, in the second innings of the
third Test Match.</p>

<p class="indent">The morning papers referred to him as "that
phenomenal trundler, the young Middlesex
amateur"; the sporting press hailed him as "the
left-handed devastation-merchant"; and the
evening "specials" called him "Pip," pure and
simple.</p>

<p class="indent">To do him justice, Pip cared for none of these
things. He was much more concerned with the
future than the present. He had scraped a pass
degree at Cambridge, and was now nominally
studying medicine. But he knew in his heart
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
that he had not the brains to succeed in his
task, and he persevered only to please his father,
who, though he admitted that his son could
never hope to put up a specialist's plate in Harley
Street, considered him (just as a race-horse
might consider that anything on four legs can
haul a cab) quite capable of doing well in a
country practice.</p>

<p class="indent">One morning in July Pip received an invitation
to play in the Rustleford Cricket Week, an honour
calculated to inflate the chest of any rising
amateur with legitimate pride. John Chell, the
Squire of Rustleford Manor, was of a type now
too rare. An old Grandwich captain, an old
Oxford captain, and an old All England Eleven
player, descended from a long line of top-hatted
cricketers, he devoted what he called his "declining
years" to fostering the spirit of the game.
Rustleford Manor was one of the strongholds of
English cricket. John Chell's reputation as a
judge of the game was a recognised asset of the
English Selection Committee, and more than one
great professional had received his first chance
on the Rustleford ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was not intimately acquainted with John
Chell, though he had frequently met him at
Lord's and elsewhere, and had known his son
Jacky at Cambridge. But he was genuinely
pleased with this recognition of his merit. It
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;183]</span>
was a thing apart from journalistic celebrity and
the adulation of a Surrey crowd. No man was
invited to Rustleford who was not a cricketer,
out and out; and a man who played in the
Rustleford Manor Eleven was hall-marked for
life.</p>

<p class="indent">The night before his departure he dined alone
with his father. Pipette was out at the theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">The great physician looked aged and ill, and
Pip, noticing this for the first time,&mdash;we are
unobservant creatures where our daily companions
are concerned,&mdash;and stricken with sudden
pity, offered to abandon his cherished cricket
week and accompany his father on a short holiday
to a health resort.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't get away, my boy," he said. "Wish
I could. But it can't be done. I have consultations
every day for five weeks, and hospital work
as well. After that, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"After that your fixture-card will have been
still further filled up," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">His father laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"You are right," he said, "I believe it will:
it's a way it has."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, why not fix up a month's holiday, say
in five weeks' time, and stick to it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And who is going to do my work?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish <i>I</i> could," said Pip, impulsively for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;184]</span>
him. "Dad, I must be a devil of a disappointment
to you. Fancy you&mdash;and me!"</p>

<p class="indent">By the latter rather condensed expression Pip
meant to express his surprise that such a clever
father should have produced such a stupid son.</p>

<p class="indent">"We don't all get ten talents, old man," said
his father. "But soon, I dare say, when you are
qualified, there will be lots&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip put down his glass of port.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dad, I shall never be qualified," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I haven't got it in me. You are so
clever that you can't conceive what a fool's
brain can be like. I tell you honestly that this
thing is beyond me, Governor. I have worked
pretty hard&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know that," said his father heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;And I think I am rather more at sea now
than I was four years ago. I have learned a few
things by heart&mdash;anything that can be picked
up by those jingles and tips that coaches give one&mdash;and
that is just about all. Fancy me going
over a patient's ribs and mumbling rhymes to
myself to remind me what part of his anatomy
I had got to!"</p>

<p class="indent">Father and son laughed. Some of the <i>memoria
technica</i> of the medical student are peculiar.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been meaning to tell you a long time,"
continued Pip, "but I saw you were keen on my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;185]</span>
getting through, if possible, so I stuck to it. I
think I know my limits. I'm not cut out for the
learned professions. Fact is, I'm a blamed fool."</p>

<p class="indent">They smoked on silently after that. The doctor
was not altogether surprised at Pip's outburst,
for he had lately been realising, from the
casual utterances of lecturers and examiners of
his acquaintance, that Pip's prospects were hopeless.
But he was sadly disappointed for all that.
He had been a lonely man all his life, and now,
especially that his health was uncertain, he
realised the unhappy fact that his son&mdash;his big,
strong, healthy son, to whose intellectual companionship
he had looked forward so eagerly&mdash;was
never to give him a shoulder to lean on save
in a physical sense.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment, much to the relief of both,
the door opened and Pipette came in. She was
just twenty-two, and to the tired man in the
armchair by the fire she was her mother over
again.</p>

<p class="indent">She threw off her opera-cloak and wrap and
slipped into the chair beside her father. Then
after one brief glance into his face she inquired&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, old boy, what's the trouble?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip wants me to go for a holiday," said her
father.</p>

<p class="indent">"Carried unanimously!" announced Pipette.
"When shall we start?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;186]</span>
"Can't be done at present. Too busy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Get somebody from the hospital staff to do
your work."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear, hear!" said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Wilmot gazed into the fire. Presently he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not altogether professional work. Pip,
you said just now that you were a blamed fool.
Your father is another."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let us hear all about it," said Pipette
maternally.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I am a prosperous man as professional
men go. But a few years ago I realised a good
many of my investments&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What does that mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I sacrificed my savings to get ready money,
to finance that private cancer-research commission
that Sir John Lindon and I got up,&mdash;you
remember, Pip?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; go on."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, the Government ultimately paid the
expenses of the commission,&mdash;we shamed them
into it,&mdash;and I got my money back. When I
came to reinvest it, instead of putting it into the
old safe place, I devoted most of it to buying
shares in a wild-cat Australian scheme&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Which has gone bust?" said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not quite. But the shares are down to the
bottom mark, and there is no dividend. I believe
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;187]</span>
the thing is sound, and that in a year or two we
shall be all right again. Meanwhile&mdash;meanwhile,
children, I am extremely hard up!"</p>

<p class="indent">To people who have never been hungrier than
an unpunctual cook can make them, the prospect
of actual poverty is always rather sobering.
There was a long pause. Presently Pipette
slipped a soft and protecting arm round her
father's neck.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dad," she asked, "why did you buy those
queer shares?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To get rich quick."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why quick?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because"&mdash;the doctor hesitated, surveyed
his son and daughter rather doubtfully, and
finally proceeded&mdash;"because human life in general
is an uncertain thing, old lady, and my life
in particular happens to be&mdash;don't choke me,
child!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette's encircling arm had grown suddenly
rigid, and her father heard her heart flutter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wh&mdash;what do you mean, Daddy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean that I possess what insurance companies
call 'a bad life.' Nothing serious&mdash;slight
heart trouble, that's all. I shall have to be careful
for a bit, and all will be well. It's the cracked
pitcher that lasts longest." Dr. Wilmot had unconsciously
dropped into the easy and optimistic
tones which he reserved for nervous patients.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;188]</span>
After a little further conversation Pip and
Pipette, somewhat reassured, retired to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning Pip departed to Rustleford, but
not before he had conferred briefly with Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think I ought to leave the Governor?"
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette puckered her alabaster brow thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; why not?" she replied at length. "It
isn't as if he were in bed or anything. He'll go
to his work just the same whether you are here
or not. I have made him faithfully promise to
come away for a holiday for the whole of September,
so we must just let him have his way just
now. You go and enjoy yourself, little man. I'll
look after him. Besides"&mdash;Pipette's angelic
features relaxed into the suspicion of a smirk&mdash;"I
heard yesterday that a particular friend of
yours was to be there."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who? Linklater?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;a lady."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not Madeline&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear no. I thought you had forgotten her.
Can't you guess?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip turned a delicate plum colour.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, now you are getting nearer," said Pipette.
"It's your little flapper friend, Elsie
Innes. How long is it since you saw her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About a year, I think. She has been away
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;189]</span>
from town a lot lately," replied Pip, rather
incautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"She has put her hair up," said Pipette.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">That evening Pip arrived at Rustleford.</p>

<p class="indent">He was hospitably greeted by John Chell,
introduced to Mrs. Chell, Miss Emily Chell, and
Miss Dorothy Chell, renewed his acquaintance
with Jacky Chell, and then turned to the inspection
of the rest of the house-party, most of
whom were known to him.</p>

<p class="indent">The cricketers were headed by Raven Innes,
a little past his best now, but still to be reckoned
among the six finest bats in England. Then
came Mallaby and Oake, the Oxford and Cambridge
captains for that year. There was also a
comic man&mdash;the Squire knew well that it takes
all sorts to make an Eleven&mdash;a member of a
noble house, with a polysyllabic and historic
title; but nobody ever called him anything but
"Cockles." There were one or two county cricketers
of established merit, with or against whom
Pip had waged many a gallant battle; and it was
reported that the Squire had up his sleeve a young
local professional, who would one day be the
finest fast bowler in England.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, there were two guests who require
more elaborate introduction. The first was a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;190]</span>
young man of about twenty-three. His name
was Gresley. His father was sole proprietor of
the Gresley Motor Works, and (it was said) a
man of millions. He had sent his only son to
Cambridge; and the son, a shy and retiring boy,
after devoting his first two years to the study
of mechanical science, oblivious of the glad fact
that the world contained other things to do, had
suddenly sprung into fame, almost <i>malgr√© lui</i>, as
a bowler of absolutely natural "googlies," which
fearsome term means an off-break with a leg-break
action. This priceless talent had been
accidentally discovered by Pip during a visit to
Gresley's home in the vacation, in the course of
a game of stump-cricket on the lawn after lunch.
A year later Gresley had played for Cambridge
at Lord's, with a success which had qualified
him for an invitation to Rustleford. Indeed it
was to him, together with Pip and the Squire's
professional dark horse, that the Eleven looked
for its wickets. Gresley was a small, slim fellow,
looking much younger than he really was. He
had been brought up by his widowed father almost
by hand, and had never been to a public
school. He was not quite at his ease in a crowd
of people, and was devotedly attached to Pip,
who had done him more than one good turn since
they became acquainted.</p>

<p class="indent">The other man, Cullyngham, was of a very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;191]</span>
different type; and indeed Pip's first action on
catching sight of him playing bridge in the hall
was to seek out Raven Innes and inquire, with
unusual heat, what "that swine" was doing in
the house.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't say, laddie," said Innes. "The Squire
asked him, not I. I suppose he has only met him
casually, and just knows him as a first-class
cricketer."</p>

<p class="indent">"First-class cad!" grumbled Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite so, my son; but it's not our house, and
he's not our guest. Still, it will do no harm to
keep an eye on him."</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden idea struck Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wouldn't it be a sound scheme," he suggested,
"to warn your young sister about him?"</p>

<p class="indent">Raven cocked an inquiring eye at him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why her in particular?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I meant all of them," corrected Pip, rather
lamely.</p>

<p class="indent">"I've only got one."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no; I meant all the girls here."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not much," said the sagacious Raven;
"they'd be after him like bees!"</p>

<p class="indent">After that the conversation reverted to ordinary
channels, and Pip was apprised of the
week's programme. On the morrow, Wednesday,
the House Eleven, under the Squire himself,
would play the village, led by the Vicar&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;192]</span>
time-honoured fixture. Thursday would be an
off-day; on Friday they would meet the Grandwich
Old Boys, who were on tour and would
put up at "The George"; and on Saturday
would come the tug-of-war, the match against
the Gentlemen of the County, who were reputed
to have whipped up a red-hot side.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who had arrived late for tea, met the
ladies of the party in the drawing-room before
dinner. They were of the usual diverse types.
There was Kitty Davenport, slangy and mannish,
who would not thank you for describing
her as "a charming girl," but would be your
firm friend if you called her "a good sort."
There were the Misses Chell, fresh, unaffected,
and healthily English. There were the two Calthrop
girls, pretty, helpless, and clinging&mdash;a
dangerous sort this, O young man!&mdash;together
with an assortment of girls who were plain but
lively, and girls who were dull but pretty, and a
few less fortunate girls who were neither lively
nor pretty. There was a solitary "flapper" of
fifteen, who, untrammelled as yet by fear of
Mrs. Grundy, was having the time of her life
with the two callowest members of the Eleven.</p>

<p class="indent">And there was Elsie. Pip encountered her
suddenly on the staircase. She was clad in the
severely simple white frock that marks the
<i>d√©butante</i>, and her lint-coloured hair was "up,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;193]</span>
as Pipette had said. It was two years since
Pip had seen her, for she had been to a finishing-school
in Paris. He shook her hand in a manner
which left that member limp and bloodless for
the rest of the evening, and accompanied her
downstairs, to find on reaching the hall that
some never-to-be-sufficiently-blessed fairy had
arranged that he was to take her in to dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">The most confirmed believer in the decadence
of the Anglo-Saxon race might have been converted
by the sight of the company round Squire
Chell's table that night. Young men and maidens,
healthy, noisy, effervescent, ate and drank,
babbled and laughed, flirted and squabbled with
whole-hearted thoroughness from the soup to the
savoury; and Pip, sitting silently ecstatic by
Elsie, beheld the scene and suddenly realised
that life was very good. What a splendid assemblage!
The girls, of course, were girls, and as such
beyond criticism. And the men? Maybe they
were youthful and conventional,&mdash;each would
probably have cut his own father dead in the
street if he had met him wearing a made-up tie,&mdash;but
Pip knew that they were for the most part
clean-run, straight-going people like himself,
good fellows, "white" men all. With one exception.
And suddenly Pip realised that the exception
was sitting on the other side of Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham was smiling and talking. He
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;194]</span>
always was smiling. He smiled when he made
a century. He smiled when he made a blob. He
smiled when a rising ball hit him on the knuckles.
He was smiling now, and Elsie was smiling too;
and Pip felt suddenly murderous.</p>

<p class="indent">They were talking of golf. Elsie, who had
spent most of her life on the east coast of Scotland,
was discussing matters that were Greek to
poor cricketing Pip,&mdash;stymies, mashies, Kites,
Falcons, and other fearful wild-fowl,&mdash;and
Cullyngham was offering to play Elsie a match
round the home course next day. A brief review
in Pip's mind of the most expeditious forms of
assassination was interrupted by a cheery hail
across the table from Jacky Chell, a hearty but
tactless youth of boisterous temperament.</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite like old times, seeing you and Cully
together, Pip," he cried. "Played each other
any billiard matches lately?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie scented a story.</p>

<p class="indent">"What billiard match?" she inquired, turning
to Pip. "Did you two play much together at
Cambridge?"</p>

<p class="indent">By this time Jacky Chell's stentorian laughter
had reduced the table to silence, and all waited
for Pip's answer, which when it finally came,
was to the effect that Jacky Chell had better
dry up. Cullyngham continued to smile, apparently
without effort.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;195]</span>
"What is the story, Jacky?" said the Squire
down the table.</p>

<p class="indent">"Cockles will tell it," said Jacky. "He'll
make much more of it than I can."</p>

<p class="indent">The patrician humourist, thus flatteringly introduced
into the conversation, readily took up
his parable.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, it fell out on this wise, ladies <i>and</i> gents,"
he began. "Old Cully here regards himself as an
absolutely top-hole pill-player, and one day he
was laying off to some of us in the Pitt&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"In the <i>what</i>?" exclaimed Mrs. Chell.</p>

<p class="indent">"Undergraduates' Club," interpolated her husband
swiftly. "Go on, Cockles."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, suddenly Pip cuts in and says, 'Look
here, you've talked about your billiards for the
last twenty minutes. I'll play you a hundred
up now and beat you!'"</p>

<p class="indent">"And did he?" said several ladies.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wait a bit, <i>if</i> you please. None of us knew
much about Pip's game, as he had just joined
the club, but we all went into the billiard place
next door, and I stood on a sofa and made a
book&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What price?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Three to one on Cully."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who <i>won</i>?" cried the flapper.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Wait</i> a bit," said Cockles severely. "Don't
crab my story. Cully went off at the start and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;196]</span>
rattled up a couple of fifteens almost before Pip
got his cue chalked. He reached his fifty just
as Pip got to five."</p>

<p class="indent">Sensation.</p>

<p class="indent">"The odds," continued the narrator, smacking
his lips, "then receded to ten to one, and no
takers. Then Cully got to seventy-five just after
Pip had reached eighteen&mdash;wasn't it, Pip?"</p>

<p class="indent">No reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Right-o! Never mind if you're shy. Anyhow,
old Cully, being naturally a bit above himself,
gave a sort of chuckle, and said, 'What odds
now, Pip, old man?'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ooh!" said Miss Dorothy Chell. "How rash!
It was quite enough to change your luck, Mr.
Cullyngham."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you tap wood when you said it, Mr.
Cullyngham?" screamed the flapper down the
table.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cullyngham, possibly owing to the effort
involved in keeping up a protracted smile, did
not reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," continued Cockles, "Pip just turned
to him and said, 'I won't take any odds, but I'm
da&mdash;blessed if I don't beat you yet.' And my
word, do you know what he did?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" came from all corners of the table.</p>

<p class="indent">"He got the balls together a few minutes
later, settled down&mdash;and ran out!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;197]</span>
"What for?" inquired Miss Calthrop languidly.</p>

<p class="indent">"What for? He <i>won</i>. A break of eighty-three,
unfinished. He wouldn't go on. Said he
had come there to beat Cully, not to make a
show of himself. The old ruffian! He had lain
pretty low about his powers. Hadn't he, Cully?"</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham, to his eternal credit, still smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather!" he said. "You had me that time,
Pip, old man."</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham's good nature and tact having
smoothed over the rather jarring sensation produced
by Cockles's thoroughly tactless reminiscences,
conversation became general again. But
Pip wriggled in his seat. He hated publicity of
any kind, and he felt, moreover, that although
he was the undoubted hero of Cockles's story,
the smiling, unruffled man on the other side of
Elsie was coming out of the affair better than
he, if only by reason of the easy nonchalance
with which he had faced a situation that had
been rather unfairly forced upon him.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="indent">Next day came the match against the village.
It was a serio-comic fixture, and as such does not
call for detailed description. The Squire was
early astir in cricket flannels and Harris tweed
jacket, the latter garment being replaced at
high noon by an M.C.C. blazer which ought to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;198]</span>
have been let out at the seams twenty years ago:
and in good time all the company assembled
on the Rustleford Manor cricket-ground.</p>

<p class="indent">The village won the toss, and the Vicar, accompanied
by the blacksmith, opened the innings.
The attack was entrusted to Pip and the local
phenomenon. The latter proved to be a bowler
of appalling pace but uncertain length; and the
blacksmith, whose generous figure offered a fair
target to any ball directed within a yard of the
wicket, growing restive under the bombardment,
forgot more than once in his comments on the
situation that a clergyman was standing less
than twenty-two yards away.</p>

<p class="indent">The Vicar, an old Blue, played a skilful and
patient innings, but the blacksmith did not stay
long. As was natural, his chief stroke was a
rather laboured upheaval of the bat over his
head, followed by a downward sledge-hammer
drive across the path of the elusive ball. He
timed it correctly just once, and the ball, rebounding
from the ground like a flash, sang
over the head of the Squire at point and proceeded
to the boundary for four. That was all.
Next time, in endeavouring to bring off a particularly
pyrotechnic late cut, the batsman was
bowled. He made doubly sure of his dismissal by
simultaneously bringing down his bat upon the
top of the off-stump with a force which called
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;199]</span>
for the united efforts of the umpire and Cockles,
who was keeping wicket, to get it out again.</p>

<p class="indent">The next comer was the Vicar's son, a public-school
bat of the highest promise; and for a
merry half-hour <i>p√®re et fils</i> set Pip and partner
at defiance, and piled up runs to the credit of
the village green. It was not until the Squire's
prodigy had been taken off and Gresley put on
that the schoolboy, tempted by one of the latter's
insidious "googlies," mistimed a stroke and
put up an easy one to Raven Innes at cover-point.</p>

<p class="indent">The next batsman was the booking-clerk from
the station. Humourists on the boundary cried
out that they expected something "first-class"
this journey. They were doomed to disappointment,
for the batsman was bowled first ball, a
mishap which a facetious friend in the shade
of the refreshment tent attributed to natural
anxiety not to waste the return half of his
ticket.</p>

<p class="indent">Eighty-two for three wickets is a good score
for a village club; but when the three wickets
grew to four, and so on to six, without any appreciable
increase in the score, things cannot be
regarded as so satisfactory. A rot set in after
the Vicar was dismissed, and it was not until
the last man came in that the hundred was
reached. A really creditable stand now ensued,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;200]</span>
the village policeman laying on for Tusculum
at one end, while the curate (whom the parish
darkly suspected of ritualistic tendencies) laid
on for Rome at the other. These twain brought
up the score to a hundred and twenty, at which
point the policeman, in attempting a sort of
truncheon-stroke to point, was deftly caught at
second slip by Cullyngham.</p>

<p class="indent">The Rustleford Manor Eleven, as was usual in
this fixture, took the field tail first, a proceeding
which brought Pip to an unwontedly exalted
position in the batting-list. He went in first
wicket, two minutes after the commencement of
the innings, Gresley having knocked off his bails
in a misguided attempt to pull the first ball he
received. The other end of the pitch was occupied
by the Squire, who had gone in first in this
match for twenty years. He liked plenty of time
to make his runs, he explained, increasing girth
precluding any great feats of agility between the
wickets.</p>

<p class="indent">The bowling was shared by the Vicar and the
policeman, the former with lobs, the latter with a
delivery so frankly illegal that Pip, gazing open-mouthed
at the bowler, made no attempt to
play the first ball he received, and was nearly
bowled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather a doubtful delivery that, isn't it?" he
remarked to the umpire at the end of the over.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;201]</span>
"No possible doubt about it whatever, sir,"
said the grizzled ground-man decisively.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean to say he doesn't throw?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean to say he does throw, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then why don't you take him off?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Take him off, sir?" The veteran smiled
indulgently in the direction of the bowler. "Lor'
bless you! Now, why, sir? 'E ain't doin' no
'arm."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip could not but agree with the undeniable
correctness of this pronouncement, which was
shortly afterwards endorsed by the captain of the
side, the limb of the law being relegated to a
distant beat in the outfield and his place taken
by another. The newcomer, an erratic bowler
of great swiftness, shot his first ball into the
Squire's knee-pad, and immediately appealed for
leg-before-wicket. The village umpire, after an
obvious struggle between a desire to get rid of
a dangerous batsman and an inherent sense of
loyalty to the feudal system, finally decided in
favor of the gyrating Squire, and the game proceeded.
Pip was bowled next over by one of the
Vicar's lobs, and retired amid applause with a
score of two fours and a six to his credit.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the tent he espied Elsie. He sat down
beside her, and the subsequent proceedings interested
him no more. However, the House
Eleven, after losing five wickets for thirty runs,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;202]</span>
at last began to put real batsmen into the field.
When the match ended at six o'clock the score
was a hundred and eighty-five for seven wickets,
the Oxford and Cambridge captains, Mallaby
and Oake, being not out with fifty-five and forty-eight
respectively. By this time Pip had asked
for and been promised a lesson in golf next morning,
when there was to be no cricket.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a nine-hole course round the house
park, and here the lesson was given. After
breakfast the two repaired to the tee, where Pip,
whose whole weapon of offence consisted of an
ancient left-handed cleek (discovered in the gunroom),
made laborious and praiseworthy efforts
to imitate Elsie's St. Andrew's swing, and to
hit the little balls which she placed on the tee
for him. He had asked for the lesson from purely
ulterior motives, but in half an hour he was badly
bitten with the desire to excel at the game itself.
He no longer regarded golf as a means to an end,
but found himself liking it for its own sake. He
listened carefully to Elsie's helpful instructions,
ground his teeth when she heaved a resigned
sigh, and glowed rosily at her rare expressions
of approbation. Twelve o'clock found him still
hewing his way enthusiastically round the
course, Elsie, appreciative of his keenness but
a trifle bored, nonchalantly playing a ball to
keep him company.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;203]</span>
The afternoon was devoted to a river picnic,
at which Pip, to his huge disgust, found himself
in the wrong boat both going and returning.
Beyond a few minutes of what he called "good
work" under a tree after tea, the afternoon was
a blank for him; and it was with mingled feelings
of ordinary jealousy and real concern for the
girl that he found himself a helpless spectator
of Cullyngham's undoubted progress in Elsie's
good graces.</p>

<p class="indent">The evening was given to bridge, and Pip&mdash;one
of the few men in Great Britain who combined
the misfortune of being a hopelessly bad
player with the merit of realising the fact&mdash;played
billiards with Raven Innes till bedtime.
Next morning broke dull and cloudy, and by
the time that the Grandwich Old Boys had
won the toss and decided to bat, the clouds
broke and the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no duller or more depressing spectacle
in this world than that of two elevens waiting
in the pavilion for the rain to stop. Nervous
men who have to go in next move restlessly
about, much harassed by the exuberance of
joyous youths who play small-cricket against
the dressing-room door. Weather prophets gaze
pessimistically at the weeping heavens and shake
their heads, while optimists point out to each
other fragments of blue sky, invisible to the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;204]</span>
unbiassed eye, in distant corners of the firmament.
The pavilion bore descends upon you,
and having backed you into a corner of the
veranda, where the rain can comfortably drip
through a leak in the roof down your neck,
regales you with stories which Shem probably
told to Ham and Japheth under precisely similar
circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">On this occasion the cricketers divided their
energies pretty equally between bridge and bear-fighting.
Pip, who was in a contemplative mood,
sat smoking patiently on the veranda railing.
Presently Cullyngham, who had just cut out at
bridge, came to the doorway and looked round.
His eye fell on Pip, and he smiled in a friendly
manner.</p>

<p class="indent">"Game of picquet, old man?" he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, thanks. Get another mug!"</p>

<p class="indent">This was rude of Pip, but Cullyngham took it
angelically.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear old Pip!" he cooed. "I wish I could
say caustic things with that air. It's so effective."</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment Gresley came up the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, here's my man!" exclaimed Cullyngham.
"You are a sportsman, anyhow, Gresley. Come
and have a hand at picquet till lunch."</p>

<p class="indent">Gresley, much flattered at this notice from a
celebrity, agreed readily, and the pair disappeared
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;205]</span>
into the dressing-room, where, since the
rain continued for the greater part of the day,
they were destined to spend a considerable time.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="indent">That evening there was an impromptu dance.
It was much the same as other dances. There
was plenty of music and champagne and laughter;
and as usual several people tried, and as usual
failed, to solve the problem of how it is that an
ethereal-looking and fragile slip of a girl, wholly
incapable of carrying a scuttle of coals upstairs
or of walking five miles without collapsing, can
go through an arduous night's exercise, waltzing
strong men into a state of coma, without turning
a hair.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip did his duty manfully, though his glimpses
of Elsie were few and far between. That young
lady, whether by accident or design, had filled
her card rather fully before Pip reached her
side. Consequently it was something like midnight
when the piano and violin struck up the
waltz that she had promised him, and Pip, hastily
returning the eldest Miss Calthrop to her
base of operations, braced himself for <i>the</i> moment
of the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">He waited for some time at the door of the
dancing-room scanning the returning couples,
but Elsie did not come; and Pip, who was preeminently
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;206]</span>
a man of action, set out to look for
her.</p>

<p class="indent">He came upon the truant rather suddenly,
round a screen at the end of a passage. She was
sitting on a settee with Cullyngham, who, with
his head close to hers, was talking softly and
rather too earnestly Pip thought. On seeing
Pip, Cullyngham began to smile at once, but
Elsie looked a little confused.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dance, I think," said Pip gruffly.</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham rose to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"A thousand apologies, old boy," he said
easily. "I had no idea the music had started
again. So sorry! I surrender Miss Innes forthwith.
<i>Au revoir</i>, partner, and thank you."</p>

<p class="indent">He swung gracefully down the passage and
was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie felt a little uncomfortable. The woman
never yet lived who did not enjoy playing two
fish simultaneously, and under ordinary circumstances
Elsie would have handled her line with
all the pleasure and finesse of an expert. But
somehow Pip was different. He was not the sort
of person who shared a hook gracefully. He
was perfectly capable of disregarding the rules
of the game and making a fuss and breaking the
line, unless treated with special and separate
consideration.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose lightly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;207]</span>
"So sorry, Pip," she said, taking his arm
almost caressingly. "I didn't mean to keep
you waiting. Shall we go and dance?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Pip. "Sit down a minute, please."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie obeyed.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's only this," said Pip bluntly. "I can't
help it if I offend you. Have as little to do with
that chap as you can."</p>

<p class="indent">A brief silence, and these two young people
surveyed each other. There was no flinching
on either side. Then Elsie's eyes blazed.</p>

<p class="indent">"How paltry! How mean!" she said hotly.
"Fancy trying to do it that way!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean by 'it'?" said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie bit her lip. She had given herself away.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean," went on Pip, "that I say this
because I am jealous."</p>

<p class="indent">That was exactly what Elsie had meant, and
she knew in her heart now that she had been
wrong: Pip was not that sort. Still, she was
young and independent. Pip was young and
tactless. An older and more experienced girl
would have seen that Pip's warning was well
worth listening to. An older and more experienced
man would have delivered it in a different
way. Neither of them being possessed of these
advantages, the net result of Pip's impromptu
effort was to invest Cullyngham with a halo of
romantic mystery in the eyes of Elsie, who, after
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;208]</span>
all, was only nineteen, and a daughter of Eve at
that. Here were the elements of a pretty quarrel.</p>

<p class="indent">Five minutes later, after a hot altercation,
Elsie sailed into the ballroom alone, with her
small and admirably formed nose slightly in the
air, leaving Pip, tardily recalling Raven's advice,
to curse his tactless tongue on the settee behind
the screen.</p>

<p class="indent">To him entered young Gresley. He dropped
listlessly on to the settee.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip," he said, "I'm in a devil of a hole."</p>

<p class="indent">"What's the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm dipped&mdash;badly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh&mdash;money?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's eyes suddenly gleamed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Cullyngham?"</p>

<p class="indent">Gresley nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip rose and pulled the screen completely across
the passage.</p>

<p class="indent">"They'll think we're a spooning couple," he
said. "Go on."</p>

<p class="indent">Gresley told his story. Flattered by Cullyngham's
invitation, he had agreed to play picquet&mdash;a
game with which he enjoyed only what
may be called a domestic acquaintance&mdash;in the
pavilion before lunch.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose we will play the usual club points?"
Cullyngham had said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;209]</span>
"And like a blamed fool," continued Gresley,
"I didn't like to let on that I didn't know what
the usual club points were, but just nodded. I
lost all the time, and when he added up at one
o'clock I owed him five hundred points. He said
I must have my revenge in the afternoon if it
went on raining. Well, as you know, it did go on
raining, and by the end of the day I was fifteen
hundred points down. Then he told me, what I
hadn't had the pluck to ask him, what we were
playing for. He said that the ordinary club
points were a fiver a hundred, and that I owed
him seventy-five pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">"The d&mdash;&mdash;d swine!" said Pip through his teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Are</i> they the ordinary club points, Pip?"
said Gresley anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ordinary club grandmother! It's a swindle.
He probably cheated in the actual play, too.
What are you going to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall pay."</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite right," said Pip approvingly. "Pay
first, and then we can go for him without prejudice.
Have you got the money?"</p>

<p class="indent">The boy shook his head dismally. "About ten
pounds," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"I could raise a couple of fivers, perhaps," said
Pip. "But in any case your best plan is to go
straight and make a clean breast of it to your
Governor."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;210]</span>
"Pip, I couldn't! He's fearfully simple and
straight in these things. It would break him
up."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know him well enough," said Pip, "to be
quite certain that you ought to tell him. He
can't eat you, and he'll respect your pluck in
being frank about it. If he finds out by accident,
though&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are right, Pip. I'll do it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good! If you'll do that, I'll promise you
something in return. I'll give Master Cullyngham
such a quarter of an hour of his own previous
history that he'll leave the place to-morrow
morning and never darken its doors, or any other
doors I care to specify, again. Now, you write
straight off to your Governor; or, better still,
make an excuse and run up to town and see him
to-morrow, and leave me to tackle friend Cullyngham.
I think I shall enjoy my interview
more than you will."</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Mr. Rupert Cullyngham had divested himself
of his dress-coat, and was engaged in unfastening
a neatly tied white tie, when his bedroom door
opened and Pip came in.</p>

<p class="indent">"Cullyngham," he said, in a matter-of-fact
tone, "you must leave this house to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham turned and surveyed his visitor
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;211]</span>
for a moment with some amusement. Then he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly! No idea you had bought the
place. Can I have a trap, or must I walk?"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip did not rise to the level of this airy badinage.
On the contrary, he was brusque and
rude.</p>

<p class="indent">"You will get your cheque all right," he continued.
"It will reach you on Sunday morning,
so there's no need to hang on here for it."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I inquire&mdash;<i>what</i> cheque?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The money young Gresley owes you."</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham whistled softly.</p>

<p class="indent">"So it's to that young fool that I owe the
honour of this visit," he said. "Look here, old
chap&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip broke in.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks, I can do without that. Let us have
no rotten pretence on the subject. To be quite
frank, I was rather surprised to find you in this
house at all&mdash;so was Raven Innes. However,
we decided not to make any remark&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"That <i>was</i> decent of you!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip continued, meditatively&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Chell had probably asked you here on your
cricket reputation. However, as I find you can't
refrain from behaving like the cad you are, even
when asked down to a house like this, I have
decided to take things in hand myself. You will
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span>
make an excuse to the Chells in the morning, and
go straight away back&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham, who had been restraining himself
with difficulty, turned suddenly round and advanced
upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Get out!" he said, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who was lounging on the arm of a chair,
never stirred.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you will sit down for five minutes," he
observed steadily, "I'll give you a few reasons
for my assurance in this matter. The fact is,
Cullyngham, you aren't in a position to retaliate.
To-day, for instance, you were wearing the colours
of your old school club. You are not a member.
They don't elect people who have been&mdash;sacked.
Also, I came across a friend of yours not
long ago. She wanted your address, or rather her
daughter did. Her name was&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham, whose face had been gradually
changing from a lowering red to a delicate green,
suddenly noticed that the door was standing
ajar. He hurried across the room, shut it, and
turned the key.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later the door opened again, and
Pip stepped out into the dark passage. An item
in his host's valedictory remarks took him back
into the room again, and he stood holding the
door-handle as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"Cullyngham, you certainly owe me one for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
this, so you can blackguard me to your heart's
content. Also, you may interpret my motives
as you like; but&mdash;we will leave ladies' names
out of this question, please. Remember that!"</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="indent">At breakfast next morning, amid much masculine
concern and feminine lamentation, Cullyngham
announced that unexpected and urgent
family business called him away to town.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire expostulated.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear fellow, this is simply outrageous!
What are we to do? The Gentlemen have
whipped up the hottest side I have ever seen
on this ground, and first of all young Gresley
slips off before breakfast, and now you want to
go. We shall get simply trampled on!"</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham, his smile once again in full working
order, confessed himself utterly desolated; but
the business was of a pressing, and, he hinted,
rather painful, nature, and go he must.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly a trap was ordered round for the
twelve o'clock train, and the depleted Eleven,
together with the greater part of the house-party,
strolled down to the ground to face the redoubtable
Gentlemen of the County.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip had been promised an hour's golf with
Elsie after breakfast. He was at the tee at the
appointed hour of ten, but was not in the least
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;214]</span>
surprised when his teacher failed to put in an
appearance. After smoking patiently upon the
sand-box for a quarter of an hour, the unconscious
target of a good many curious eyes on the
terrace above, he sadly knocked the ashes out of
his pipe and returned to the house, to prepare
himself for the labours of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">This was to be no picnic match. The County
Club had no other fixture that day, so could put
its full amateur strength into the field. With
Gresley and Cullyngham playing the sides would
have been about equally balanced, but now it was
odds on the visitors.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the men of Rustleford, fortifying
themselves with the comforting reflection that
cricket, like most other departments of life, is
a game of surprises, enrolled two substitutes for
their absent warriors, and took the field with a
stout heart, having lost the toss as a preliminary.</p>

<p class="indent">There had been more rain during the night,
and the wicket, though sodden, was easy. The
Gentlemen opened nicely, scoring forty-five runs
by pretty cricket before a wicket fell. After that
two more wickets fell rather easily, and then
came another stand, during which the score rose
from forty-five to eighty, at which point the more
passive of the two resisters was given out leg-before-wicket.
Then came a <i>d√©b√¢cle</i>, absolute
and complete, but not altogether inexplicable.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;215]</span>
The clouds were dispersing rapidly, and, once free
of their nebulous embraces, the July sun began to
beat down fiercely, "queering the patch" in the
most literal sense of the word, and thus enabling
Pip and the village prodigy to dismiss an undeniably
strong batting side for a hundred and eight.</p>

<p class="indent">Loud were the congratulations of the spectators.
The ladies especially were jubilant, the
flapper going so far as to ask her two admirers
for a quotation of odds&mdash;in the current coin of
flapperdom, chocolates&mdash;against Rustleford's
chances of an innings victory. But the Squire
looked up at the blazing sun and down at the
rapidly drying pitch, and glanced inquiringly at
Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip removed his pipe from his mouth, and
grunted,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Lucky if we get half the runs."</p>

<p class="indent">As it turned out, this was an overestimate.
The Rustleford Manor Eleven went in to bat at
one o'clock precisely, and were all dismissed in
the space of forty-five minutes for forty-nine
runs. The pitch was almost unplayable; each
bowler found a "spot"; and it was only some
berserk slogging by Pip, who went in last and
refused to allow any ball to alight on the treacherous
turf at all, that this insignificant total was
not halved.</p>

<p class="indent">The Elevens lunched together in the pavilion,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;216]</span>
but the rest of the party returned to the house.
Here Elsie, who had spent a not altogether comfortable
night and morning, was somewhat surprised
to find herself seated next to Cullyngham.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought you had gone," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Unfortunately," he replied, "I came down
at twelve to drive to the station, to find that I
had misunderstood Mrs. Chell and kept the trap
too late to have any chance of catching the
train."</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind," said Elsie. "You'll be able to
come and see the match now. It is going to be
tremendously exciting."</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham lowered his head in her direction,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you let me have that round of golf this
afternoon&mdash;the one I should have had next
Monday?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie surveyed him doubtfully. Under ordinary
circumstances she would have preferred to
see the cricket, but she was not insensible to
Cullyngham's charms, and she liked the flattering
way in which he had couched his request.</p>

<p class="indent">"But the cricket?" she said. "Surely you&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Some things are worth many cricket-matches,"
said Cullyngham sententiously.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie gasped a little, and Cullyngham continued,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"You will come? Leave the cricketers to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
themselves this time. They'll get too conceited
with so much attention."</p>

<p class="indent">Now, whether Cullyngham meant this remark
to have a particular significance, or to be merely
of general application, one cannot say, but its
effect was to suggest to Elsie a most appropriate
punishment for Pip. Instead of sitting on the
pavilion lawn applauding his performance, she
would stay at home and play golf with his rival.
Little boys must be taught not to be jealous.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham called for more whiskey-and-soda.</p>

<p class="indent">The Gentlemen of the County began their
second innings after lunch. News of the exciting
state of the game had spread abroad, and the
Manor ground was rapidly being encircled by a
ring of carriages and motors, tenanted by masses
of white fluff, which at intervals disintegrated
itself into its component elements for purposes of
promenade, dress-reviewing, and refreshment.</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite plain that runs would be hard to
get on that wicket. There was a crust of dried
mud on the top and a quagmire below. The sun
still beat down strongly, the birds were celebrating
the termination of twenty-four hours' rain
in every tree, and everybody was alert and excited
at the prospect of an open game and a close
finish.</p>

<p class="indent">Their expectations were fully realised. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
Gentlemen of the County, either through anxiety
to eclipse their rivals' sensational breakdown, or
through excess of confidence, or simply because
they could not help it, scored exactly thirty-five
runs. Pip took eight wickets for sixteen. He
was always a bowler of moods, and his work in
the morning, though good enough, had not been
particularly brilliant. A man can no more take
a wicket than he can take a city unless he gives
his mind to it, and it must be confessed that up
to the luncheon interval Pip had been wool-gathering.
His interview with Cullyngham, his
rather brief night's rest, and his tiff with Elsie
had kept his wits wandering. Now, braced by
the knowledge that Cullyngham was speeding on
his way south, that Elsie was sitting safely on the
pavilion lawn, and that&mdash;most blessed of rest
cures!&mdash;there was work, hard work, before him,
Pip rolled up his sleeves, set his field, and bowled.
He made no fuss about it; he merely rose to the
top of his form and stayed there. The wickets
fell like ninepins, the crowd shouted itself hoarse,
and when it was all over, Pip, walking soberly in
with the rest, found himself punched, slapped,
and otherwise embraced by various frantic people
in the pavilion.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the forest of hands, each containing a
sizzling tumbler, that were extended towards
him, Pip observed one containing a telegram.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;219]</span>
Mechanically he took the orange-coloured envelope
with one hand and a tall tumbler with
the other, and, thrusting the former safe out of
harm's way in his pocket, devoted his attention
to the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">This done, he put on his blazer, lit his pipe,
and took up his favourite position on the railing
of the pavilion veranda, what time the two chief
batsmen of his side buckled on their pads. There
were ninety-five runs to make, and they had to
be made on a wicket in the last stages of decomposition.
The two heroes, nervous but resolute,
took the field for the last time, and, with nearly
three hours before them, set to work, slowly and
cautiously, to make the runs.</p>

<p class="indent">But Pip was not watching the cricket. His
eye was travelling steadily round the pavilion
lawn, dodging pink frocks and skipping over
blue frocks in its search for the white piqu√©
costume that Elsie had worn that morning. It
was not there.</p>

<p class="indent">Mindful that the female sex, not content with
having once successfully surmounted that most
monumental nuisance of civilisation, the daily
toilet, is addicted to inexplicable and apparently
enjoyable repetitions of the same, Pip tried
again, and scrutinised the pink frocks and the
blue frocks. Elsie was not in any of them. Pip
felt vaguely uneasy. Of course Cullyngham was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;220]</span>
almost back in town by this time. Still&mdash;The
two batsmen were making a respectable show. Pip
was to go in last. The greatest possible series of
catastrophes could not bring his services into requisition
for another twenty minutes at any rate.
He would run up to the house and see. See what?
He did not know, but he would go and see it.</p>

<p class="indent">He vaulted over a fence, slipped through a
plantation, and tramped under the hot afternoon
sun across the meadow which separated the
Manor from the cricket-ground. Suddenly, in
his pocket, his hand encountered the telegram
that had been handed to him after the innings:
it had gone right out of his memory.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wonder if it's an abusive message from
Cully," he said to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">No, it was from Pipette, and Pip sat down
on a hurdle and steadied himself after reading
it. Presently, after a stunned interval, he continued
mechanically on his way.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me see," he found himself saying,&mdash;"I
had better pack up my things, get a trap at the
stables, and catch the five-thirty train. I'll
leave a note for the Chells, and then I shan't
have to face the whole crowd again. If there's
no trap to be had I'll leave my bag and leg it.
Only a mile or so,&mdash;I wish it was more,&mdash;got
an hour and a half to fill in."</p>

<p class="indent">By this time he had reached the house. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
place was deserted, for the butler and, indeed,
most of the establishment were down at the
cricket-ground. Pip went rather heavily upstairs
and packed his portmanteau, which he
presently brought down to the hall door. After
that he went to the library and wrote a brief letter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now to find some one to leave this with,"
he said to himself. "The maids can't all be out.
After that I'll go to the stables. Hallo! That
sounded like a voice. There it is again! A sort
of shriek! It comes from the conservatory.
My God! it's&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">He hurried into the drawing-room and darted
across to the large French windows that opened
into the conservatory. Then, stepping out and
passing round a great orange tree in a green
tub, he came suddenly on a sight that caused
something inside him to gather into a sickening
knot and sink down, down, down, dragging his
very heart with it.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie and Cullyngham, the latter with his
back to Pip, were standing face to face in the
middle of the conservatory. They were pressed
close together, and both Elsie's arms were round
Cullyngham's neck.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class="indent">Somehow the golf-match was not quite as
amusing as Elsie had expected. Cullyngham was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
all deference and vivacity, and played like the
stylist he was. Still, Elsie could not help wondering
how the cricket-match was getting on;
and when at half-past three the round of nine
holes was completed, she announced her intention
of going down to the ground to see the finish.</p>

<p class="indent">"What, and desert me?" inquired her opponent
pathetically.</p>

<p class="indent">"You can come too, if you like."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hardly worth while, I'm afraid. I have to
pack my bag and get some tea, and then I shall
be due at the station."</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought your bag was packed already.
You were to have gone by the twelve train, you
know," said Elsie rather doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Cullyngham easily, "but you forgot
I had to unpack again to get out my golfing
shoes. Now, I'll tell you what," he continued
rapidly. "They are going to give me tea in the
conservatory before I go: won't you stay and
pour it out for me? Just five minutes&mdash;<i>please</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie felt that she could hardly in decency
refuse, and accompanied Cullyngham to the
house and thence to the conservatory, where
the maid who brought the tea informed them
of the glorious downfall of the County Eleven
and of Pip's share therein.</p>

<p class="indent">This decided Elsie. She had no desire to
appear in any scene where Pip was the central
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>
figure, so she accepted Cullyngham's pressing
invitation to share his tea, and, sinking into a
large armchair, prepared to spend an idle half-hour
until popular enthusiasm on the cricket-ground
should have abated. Pip was unconsciously
proving the profound wisdom of the
maxim which warns us to beware when all men
speak well of us. He was paying the penalty
of success. If he had been bowled first ball, or
had missed three easy catches, Elsie, being a
woman, would probably have melted and been
kind to him. But to unbend to him now would
savour of opportunism, hero-worship, and other
disagreeable things. Elsie set her small white
teeth, frowned at an orange tree in a green tub,
and prepared for a <i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i>. The house seemed
deserted.</p>

<p class="indent">"Penny for your thoughts!" said Cullyngham.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie smiled composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"If they were only worth that I would make
you a present of them," she said. "If they were
worth more they would not be for sale."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are they worth more?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know, really. Anyhow, they are not
on the market." She drank some tea with a
prim air, uncomfortably conscious that she was
blushing.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a short pause, and Cullyngham
spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;224]</span>
"I hope I'm not boring you," he said, with
a smile which took for granted the impossibility
of the idea.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, dear, no. I'm seldom bored at meals."
Elsie took a bite out of a bun.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well. Till you have finished tea I will
keep quiet; after that I will endeavour to amuse
you."</p>

<p class="indent">The meal continued solemnly. Once or twice
Elsie directed a furtive glance at the man beside
her, and detected him eyeing her in a manner
which made her feel hot and cold by turns. It
was not that he was rude or objectionable, but
Elsie suddenly felt conscious that Pip's open
stare of honest admiration was infinitely less
embarrassing than this.</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham, as a matter of fact, was in a
dangerous mood. His was not a pride that took
a fall easily, and the fact that he had been compelled
to submit to Pip's unconditional ultimatum
was goading him to madness. No man is altogether
bad, but we are all possessed of our own
particular devils, and Cullyngham accommodated
more than his fair share of them. He had
never denied himself the gratification of any
passion, however unworthy, and at that moment
his one consuming desire was to retaliate upon
the man who had humiliated him. He looked
around the empty conservatory, and then again
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;225]</span>
at the girl in the basket-chair beside him. He
could punish Pip now in a most exquisite manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie caught the glance, and for a moment
was suddenly conscious of an emotion hitherto
unknown to her&mdash;acute physical fear. But
Cullyngham said lightly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Enjoyed your tea?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, thanks," she replied rather tremulously,
putting down her cup.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then may I smoke?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly. But I am going now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right, if you must. I'll just light my cigarette
and see you to the end of the drive."</p>

<p class="indent">Cullyngham produced a box of matches, and,
with the paternal air of one endeavouring to
amuse a child, performed various tricks with
them. Then he lit a cigarette, and showed Elsie
how, by doubling up your tongue, it is possible
to grip the cigarette in the fold and draw it into
your mouth, reproducing it, still lighted and
glowing, a minute later.</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite a little exhibition!" said Elsie, at her
ease again. "You ought to set up as a conjurer.
Now I must be off."</p>

<p class="indent">"There is one other little trick with a match
that might amuse you," said Cullyngham. "It
was taught me by a girl I know. She made me
go down on my hands and knees&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;226]</span>
"I refuse to go down on my knees for anybody,"
said Elsie, with spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind. I will do that part. I go on
my hands and knees on the floor, like this, with
a match lying on my back between my shoulder-blades.
Then the other person&mdash;you&mdash;has his
hands tied together with a handkerchief, and
tries to brush the match off the other person's
back. It's extraordinary how difficult it is to
do it with one's hands tied and the other person
bobbing and dodging to get away from you."</p>

<p class="indent">"It sounds absolutely idiotic," said Elsie coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">"It isn't, though. Of course it would be
idiotic for you and me to play it now by ourselves;
but I'll just show you the trick of it, and
you will be able to have some sport with them
in the billiard-room to-night. Shall I show you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie agreed, without enthusiasm. It seemed
churlish to refuse such a trifling request to a
man who was making laborious efforts to amuse
her; but, for all that, this <i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i> had lasted
long enough. However, she would be on the
cricket-ground in a few minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">Her doubts were in a measure revived when
Cullyngham tied her two wrists together with
a silk handkerchief. He performed the operation
very quickly, and then dropped on to his hands
and knees on the floor and carefully balanced a
match on the broad of his back.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
"Now," he said, looking up at her, "just try
to knock that match off my back. Of course I
shall dodge all I can. I bet you won't be able to
do it."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie, feeling uncommonly foolish, made one or
two perfunctory dabs at the match with her bound
hands. Once she nearly succeeded, but Cullyngham
backed away just in time. Piqued by his
derisive little laugh, she took a quick step forward,
and leaning over him, was on the point
of brushing the match on to the floor, when suddenly
Cullyngham slewed round in her direction,
and, thrusting his head into the enclosure
of her arms, scrambled to his feet. Next moment
Elsie, dazed, numbed, terrified, found herself
on tiptoe, hanging round a man's neck, while the
man's arms were round her and his hateful smiling
face was drawing nearer, nearer, nearer to
her own.</p>

<p class="indent">Never was a girl in more deadly peril. Elsie
uttered a choking scream.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's no good, little girl," said Cullyngham.
"I've got you fast, and there's not a soul in the
house. A kiss, please!" He spoke thickly: the
man was dead within him.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie, inert and drooping, shrank back as far
as her manacled wrists would allow her, and
struggled frantically to free herself. But Cullyngham's
arms brought her towards him again.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
And then, paralysed with terror, with eyes wide
open, she found herself staring right over Cullyngham's
shoulder at&mdash;Pip!&mdash;Pip, sprung from
the earth, and standing only five yards away.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip!" she moaned; "Pip, save me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Almost simultaneously Cullyngham became
conscious of something that gripped him by the
nape of his neck, just below Elsie's fettered
wrists&mdash;something that felt like a steel vice.
Tighter and tighter grew the grip. The veins
began to stand out on Cullyngham's forehead,
and he gurgled for breath. Down he went, till his
head was once more on a level with the floor and
his aristocratic nose was rubbed into the matting.
In a moment the girl had slipped her wrists over
his head and stood free&mdash;pale, shaken, but free!</p>

<p class="indent">"Run into the house," said Pip. "I will come
in a minute."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie tottered through the French window and
disappeared, with her hands still bound before
her, and the two men were left alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Finding himself in a favourable geographical
position, Pip kicked Cullyngham till his toes
ached inside his boots. Then he thrust him
away on to the floor. Cullyngham, free at last
and white with passion, was up in a moment
and rushed at Pip. He was met by a crashing
blow in the face and went down again.</p>

<p class="indent">If Pip had been himself he would have desisted
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;229]</span>
there and then, for he had his enemy heavily
punished already. But he was in a raging passion.
He knew now that Elsie was more to him
than all the world together, and his sudden
realisation of the fact came at an inopportune
moment for Cullyngham. Pip drove him round
the conservatory, storming, raging, blaring like
an angry bull, getting in blow upon blow with
blind, relentless fury. Cullyngham was no weakling
and no coward. Again and again he stood
up to Pip, only to go down again under a smash
like the kick of a horse. Finally, in a culminating
paroxysm of frenzy, Pip took his battered
opponent in his arms and hurled him into the
green tub containing the orange tree.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he went into the house, locking the
French window behind him. The fit had passed.</p>

<p class="indent">Five minutes devoted to a wash, and a slight
readjustment of his collar and tie, and Pip was
himself again. Presently he went to seek Elsie.
The girl had succeeded in freeing her hands from
the handkerchief, and was sitting, badly shaken,
a poor little "figure of interment," as the French
say, on a sofa in the library. She looked up
eagerly at his approach.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Pip, did you hurt him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope so," said Pip simply. "Will you tell
how it happened? At least&mdash;don't, if you'd
rather not."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;230]</span>
But she told him all. "You were just in time,
Pip," she concluded. "I was just going to faint,
I think."</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him with shining eyes. Pip
saw them, and permitted himself one brief gaze.
This was no time for tender passages. He put
his hand in his pocket and produced a rather
crumpled envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">"Would you mind giving that to the Squire
for me?" he said. "I have to go away."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go away? Oh, Pip! Now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, you see, I have just&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"But are you going to leave me in the house
with that man?" cried Elsie, with a sudden access
of her old terror.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I am any judge of human nature," said
Pip, "he is out of the house by this time. I
don't think he will even wait for his luggage.
He&mdash;he's not very presentable. I see the trap
has come round for him. It can take me instead,
and I'll cart his luggage up to town and
leave it at his club. I owe him some consideration,"
he added, surveying his knuckles thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie acquiesced.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, that will be best," she said. "The
Chells will think he went off in the ordinary
way, and nobody will ever know&mdash;Pip, it was
awful."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;231]</span>
She broke off, and shuddered again and again.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should go and lie down till dinner if I were
you," said Pip gently. "All over now: forget
it. Good-bye."</p>

<p class="indent">They shook hands and walked to the door together.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why are you going away like this?" said
Elsie, as the groom piled the luggage into the
trap.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's face clouded.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm ashamed to say that what has happened
made me forget for a bit," he said. "I have just
had a wire from Pipette&mdash;I say, here is the whole
cricket-party coming across the lawn! I simply
can't face them now. I could have told you
about it, but not them. Good-bye, and&mdash;good-bye.
I shall see you again soon, I hope."</p>

<p class="indent">He jumped into the cart, and was rattling
down the drive by the time that the cricketers
and their attendant throng, hot, noisy, and jubilant,
burst like a wave into the hall. Elsie turned
hastily from a window as they entered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo, Elsie," cried Raven Innes, "what are
you doing here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather a headache, Raven. I have stayed
in since tea," said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"You certainly don't look very well, dear,"
said Mrs. Chell.</p>

<p class="indent">"You missed a great finish," said Cockles.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>
"Only two wickets," shrieked the flapper.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," added the Squire, "and if one of them
had gone down we should have been dished.
Pip deserted. Where was the ruffian? Have you
seen anything of him, my dear?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Elsie; "he was here just now."</p>

<p class="indent">One or two knowing smiles illuminated the
honest faces of the cricketers.</p>

<p class="indent">"He came up," she continued composedly,
"about four, and hurried away to catch the five-thirty
train. He has just gone. He gave me this
note for you, Mr. Chell."</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire took the note and read it, and his
jolly face grew grave.</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor fellow!" he said soberly.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it?" said everybody.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip has had a wire from his sister to say that
his father died suddenly this morning&mdash;heart
failure. Pip has slipped away by the afternoon
train: he did not want to spoil our fun. He asks
me to say good-bye to all of you from him."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_8" id="CHAPTER_8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>LIFE AT FIRST-HAND</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Pip</span> reached London that evening to find the
great gloomy house in Westock Square shuttered
and silent. His father's brougham had driven
up as usual at lunch-time, after the morning
round, and its owner had been discovered lying
in a dead faint inside it. He had been carried
into the house, to die&mdash;not even in his bed.
Death, with whom he had waged a vicarious
and more than commonly successful warfare for
thirty-one years, had conquered at last, and that,
too, with grim irony, in the very arena of the
dead man's triumphs&mdash;his own consulting-room.
The great physician lay peacefully on
an operating-couch near the darkened window,
surrounded by life-saving appliances and books
that tell how death may be averted.</p>

<p class="indent">His affairs were in a hopeless tangle. He had
risked almost every penny he possessed in an ill-judged
effort to "get rich quick," and so provide
for himself, or at any rate for his family, however
sudden and direct the course that his malady
might take. Half his capital had been sunk in
unremunerative investments, which might or
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;234]</span>
might not pay fifty per cent some day; and the
other half was gone beyond recall on an unrealised
anticipation of a fall in copper shares.</p>

<p class="indent">A week later Pip, Pipette, and Mr. Hanbury&mdash;the
latter ten years older than when we last
heard of him, but not much changed except for
a little reasonable adiposity&mdash;sat at dinner. It
was almost the last meal they were to take in the
old house, for now <i>res angust√¶</i> were to be the
order of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">The meal ended, and coffee having been served,
Pipette, looking pale and pretty in her black
evening frock, gave each of the men a cigar,
snipping the ends herself, as she had been accustomed
to do for her father; and the trio composed
themselves to conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">"I saw Crampton to-day," said Pip. (Crampton
was the family lawyer.) "He gave me the
facts and figures about things. I couldn't follow
all the stuff on blue paper, but I asked him questions
and jotted down what I wanted."</p>

<p class="indent">"How does it work out?" inquired Hanbury.</p>

<p class="indent">"By putting what money there is in the bank
into Consols, and adding the interest on the few
investments that are paying anything at all, the
total income of the estate comes to exactly one
hundred and fifty a year," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"So long as the capital sunk in the other
investments produces nothing, that is?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
"Yes. There is a matter of fifteen thousand
pounds buried in some Australian mining group:
it might as well be sunk in the sea for all the good
it is doing us. Of course it may turn up trumps
some day, but not at present, Crampton says.
So Pipette and I are worth just a hundred and
fifty a year between us."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence, and the ash on Pip's cigar
was perceptibly longer when he spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">"A hundred and fifty," he said, "is not much
use for two, but it's a comfortable little sum for
one; so Pipette is going to take it all."</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette came round and sat on the arm of
Pip's chair with the air of one who wishes to
argue the point, and Pip continued hurriedly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"We talked it over with her this afternoon,
Ham, and she agreed with me that for the present
it will be best for her to accept the Rossiters'
invitation to join them on their visit to Spain and
Algiers, which is to last about a year. Pipette
will be able to pay her full share of the expenses,
so she won't be dependent on anybody. At the
same time she will be having a good time with
really nice people instead of&mdash;instead of&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Instead of sitting all day in a two-pair-back
in London?" said Hanbury.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's it, exactly," said Pip, grateful for this
moral support. "Of course it would be ripping".&mdash;Pipette
was beginning to shake, and he put
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;236]</span>
his arm clumsily round her&mdash;"it would be ripping
to have remained together, but it can't be
done at present. In a year, perhaps. The old
lady has been very sensible about it."</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently being "sensible" did not include
abstinence from tears, for Pipette was now weeping
softly. She had lost her father only a week,
and now she was to lose her beloved brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Hanbury, who, like most strong men, was
helpless against feminine tears, coughed self-consciously.</p>

<p class="indent">"It sounds a good arrangement," he said. "I
suppose it is quite impossible for you two to live
together? With the hundred and fifty, and what
you could make yourself, Pip&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"How am I going to make it?" inquired Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"What are your prospects?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What are my accomplishments? I am just
twenty-five; I am sound in wind and limb; and I
sometimes take wickets. Can you suggest anything
else?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; you possess a stout heart and a hard
head."</p>

<p class="indent">"If by hard you mean thick, I do," agreed
Pip dismally.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thick heads have their market like everything
else. Where are you going to take
yours?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Where would you suggest? I have my own
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;237]</span>
ideas on the subject, of course, but I should like
to hear yours, Ham."</p>

<p class="indent">Hanbury looked across at him quizzically.</p>

<p class="indent">"My young friend," he said, with a flash of his
old pedagogic manner, "long experience of your
character warns me that you have determined on
some crack-brained scheme, and are now prepared
to defend it against all comers. Proceed."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip grinned.</p>

<p class="indent">"As you like," he said. "But I think a discussion
would clear the air. Here goes! Pipette
is appointed chairman. The subject for debate
is 'The Choice of a Career for a Young Man
without Education, Ability, or Prospects.' Fire
away, Ham, and bear in mind that all the
learned professions are barred to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm not sure of that. How about school-mastering?"</p>

<p class="indent">"At a Preparatory?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you recommend the billet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Frankly&mdash;no. Preparatory work is all right
provided that you don't mind a berth in which
your real work only begins at playtime, and
which, unless you can afford ultimately to set
up for yourself, offers you an absolutely maximum
screw of about two hundred a year."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know the sort of thing," said Pip. "You
start on about eighty, with board&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
"Which means a poky dust-hole to sleep in,
meat-tea, and&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>The post is one we can unreservedly recommend</i>'&mdash;I
know."</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>Write promptly yet carefully,</i>'" chanted
Ham, "'<i>to the Principal, the Rev. Adolphus
Buggins</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>Explaining that you have heard of this vacancy
through our agency</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>Stating your degree and previous experience
(if any)</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>If a member of the Church of England</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>Your willingness to participate in school
games</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>If musical</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>If possible, a photograph</i>'&mdash;yah!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't you think we are rather wandering
from the point?" inquired the mystified chairwoman.</p>

<p class="indent">The rhapsodists ceased their antistrophes and
apologised.</p>

<p class="indent">"True," said Ham. "Suggestion number one
is negatived without a division. Let us try a
fresh cast. Have you any influence with business
firms?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, thank God!" said Pip simply. "An office
would just kill me. If I had any chance of a post
I should of course have to apply; but I haven't,
so I needn't."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
There was another pause.</p>

<p class="indent">"If," said Ham reflectively, "there was any
prospect of your sunken capital rising to the surface
again, say in two or three years' time, and it
was simply a matter of hanging on till then, you
could afford to spend the intervening period in a
very interesting fashion."</p>

<p class="indent">"As how?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Go and see the world for yourself, above and
below, inside and out. Knock about and rub
shoulders with all sorts of folk. Plunge beneath
the surface and see things as they are. Make
your way everywhere, and if possible live by the
work of your own two hands. You would acquire
a knowledge of mankind that few men possess.
At the worst you could hang on and make a
living somehow until your ship came in&mdash;if it
were only as a dock-hand or a railway porter.
It would be a grand chance, Pip. Most men are
so unenterprising. Those at the top never want
to see what things are like below, and those below
are so afraid of staying there forever that their
eyes are constantly turned upwards and they
miss a lot. I'd give something to be a vagabond
for a year or two."</p>

<p class="indent">"What fearful sentiments for a respectable
house-master!" said Pipette severely; but Pip's
eyes glowed.</p>

<p class="indent">"However," continued Hanbury more soberly,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
"Pip can't afford to waste time observing life
in a purely academic way down in the basement.
He must start getting upstairs at once."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear, hear!" said the chairwoman.</p>

<p class="indent">"As a matter of fact," said Pip, "the scheme
I have in my eye rather meets the case, I think."</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I made a list of all the careers open to
me. I'll go through them."</p>

<p class="indent">Though his final choice was all they wished to
know, his audience settled themselves patiently
to listen. They knew it was useless to hurry Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"The things I thought of," continued the
orator, "are&mdash;cricket-pro, gamekeeper, policeman,
emigrant to Canada, and Tommy."</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled genially upon his gaping companions.
"They are all good open-air jobs," he
explained.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette stiffened in her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"But they will none of them do," he added.</p>

<p class="indent">Pipette relaxed again.</p>

<p class="indent">"This," said Hanbury, "is interesting and
human. We must have your reasons for rejecting
these noble callings, <i>seriatim</i>. A cricket-pro, for
instance?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Once a 'pro' always a 'pro,'" said Pip. "I
hope some day to play as an amateur again. And
while we are on the subject, I may as well say
that I'm <i>not</i> going to be a professional-amateur.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;241]</span>
No two hundred a year as assistant-deputy-under-secretary
to a county club for me, please!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Good boy," said Hanbury. "Now, please&mdash;gamekeeper?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm too old. A gamekeeper requires to be
born to the job. I have the ordinary sporting
man's knowledge of game and sport generally,
but I should be a hundred before I learned as
much about the real ins and outs of the business
as&mdash;a poacher's baby."</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite so. Policeman?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The only chance of promotion in the police
force is in the detective direction, and I&mdash;I
think detection comes under the head of learned
professions."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tommy, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A Tommy's would be a grand life if there
was always a war. But, Ham, think what the
existence of a gentleman-ranker must be in time
of peace. A few hours' duty a day, and the rest&mdash;beer
and nursemaids! Help!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You have been devoting much time to reflection,
Pip. Well, to continue. How about
emigrating?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Emigration is such a tremendously big step.
If one is prepared for it, well and good. But I'm
not ripe yet. You see, Canada and Australia are
so far away, and I'm not quite prepared to give
up&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;242]</span>
"England, home, <i>and</i> beauty&mdash;eh, Pip? Is
that how the wind blows?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Dry up!" said Pip, hastily passing on to his
peroration. "Before I try any of these things I
am going to see how my own pet scheme pans
out."</p>

<p class="indent">"And that is&mdash;?" said Pipette breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I can use my hands a bit, and have a sort of
rough knowledge of mechanics," continued Pip,
staring into the fire and stating his case with
maddening deliberation, "and I don't mind hard
work. Mind you&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, <i>do</i> get on!" almost screamed poor
Pipette.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, looking slightly surprised, came to the
point.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am going to try for a job," said he, "at a
big motor works I know of. I will start as a
cleaner, or greaser, or anything they please, if
they'll take me; and when I have got a practical
knowledge of the ins and outs of the business, I
shall try to set up as a chauffeur."</p>

<p class="indent">He broke off, and scanned his hearers' faces
rather defiantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you like the idea?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'd get horribly dirty, Pip," said practical
Pipette. "Think of the oil!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip laughed. "I'll get used to that."</p>

<p class="indent">"And how long would you stick to it?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;243]</span>
"What, the oil?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, the trade."</p>

<p class="indent">"That depends. If I find the life absolutely
unbearable for any reason&mdash;Trades Unions, for
instance&mdash;I shall jack it up. But I don't think
it is very likely."</p>

<p class="indent">"Neither do I," said Hanbury, who had had
exceptional opportunities for studying Pip's character.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then," continued Pip, with something like
enthusiasm, "if those sunken shares took up,
and there was money to be had, I might buy
myself a partnership in a motor business. If
they don't take up, I must just save my wages
till I can afford to go out and farm in Canada.
I'll take you with me, Pipette, if I go," he added
reassuringly.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">A month later Pip obtained a humble and
oleaginous appointment at the Gresley Motor
Works in Westminster Bridge Road.</p>

<p class="indent">The foreman who engaged him was short-handed
at the time, and though Pip was obviously
too old for a beginner, he was impressed
with his thews and sinews. After a few weeks,
finding that Pip did not drink, and if given a
job, however trivial, to perform, could be relied
on with absolute certainty to complete it on time,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;244]</span>
the foreman unbent still further, and paid Pip
the compliment of heaping upon him work that
should have been done by more competent but
less dependable folk. Pip throve under this
treatment, and in spite of the aloofness of his
fellow-workmen, who scented a "toff," the
novelty and genuine usefulness of his new life
inspired him with a zest and enthusiasm that
took him over many rough places.</p>

<p class="indent">For it was not all plain sailing. The horny-handed
son of toil is no doubt the salt of the
earth and the backbone of the British nation,
but he is not always an amenable companion,
and he is apt to regard habitual sobriety and
strict attention to duty in a colleague as a species
of indirect insult to himself. However, abundance
of good temper, together with a few hard
knocks when occasion demanded, soon smoothed
over Pip's difficulties in this direction; and presently
the staff of Gresley's left him pretty much
to himself, tacitly agreeing to regard him as an
eccentric but harmless lunatic who liked work.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip purposely avoided young Gresley when he
applied for the post. His idea was to obtain
employment independently, if possible, and only
to appeal to his friend as a last resource. He
was anxious, too, to spare Gresley the undoubted
embarrassment of having to oblige a venerated
member of his own college and club by appointing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;245]</span>
him to a job worth less than thirty shillings
a week. Gresley, moreover, would probably have
foisted him into a position for which he was
totally unfitted, or would have pressed a large
salary on him in return for purely nominal services.
Pip was determined that what he made
he would earn, and so he started quietly and
anonymously at the foot of the ladder. He even
adopted a <i>nom de guerre</i>, lest a glance at the
time-sheet or pay-list should betray his identity
to his employer. The Gresley Works contained
seven hundred men, and it was not likely, Pip
thought, that young Gresley, who, though he
was seen frequently about the shops, spent most
of his time in the drawing-office, would recognise
even his most admired friend amid a horde of
grimy mechanics.</p>

<p class="indent">But for all that they met, as they were bound
to do. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Pip's
reliability and general smartness soon raised him
from the ruck of his mates, and presently his
increasing responsibilities began to bring him
in contact with those in authority. He had not
counted on this; so, realising that recognition
was now only a matter of time, and wishing to
avoid the embarrassment of an unpremeditated
meeting in the works, he waylaid his friend one
morning in a quiet storehouse. The surprise
took young Gresley's breath away, and Pip took
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;246]</span>
advantage of the period preceding its return to
give a hurried explanation of his presence there,
coupled with a request that his anonymity might
be respected.</p>

<p class="indent">That night young Gresley, filled with admiration,
told the whole story to his father.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, Dad, you'll move him up to a good
post at once?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Gresley, leaning his scraggy face upon his
hand, replied curtly, "I shall do no such thing."</p>

<p class="indent">The son, who knew that his father never said
a thing without reason, waited.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wilmot? He was the young fellow who
helped you when you went fooling away your
money at cards, wasn't he?" continued the old
man, suddenly turning his Napoleonic eye upon
his son.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. He pulled me out of a tight place."</p>

<p class="indent">"That young man wouldn't thank me for
undeserved promotion. He has the right stuff
in him, and he wants to do things from the beginning&mdash;the
only way! I often wish that you
had had to start in the same fashion, Harry:
there's nothing like it for making men. But
your foolish old dad had been over the ground
before you, and that made things easy. What
that boy wants is work. I'll see he gets it, and
I'll watch how he does it, and I'll take care that
he is paid according to his merits."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;247]</span>
Consequently Pip, much to his relief, was left in
undisturbed possession of his self-sought limbo,
and made the recipient of an ever-increasing
load of work,&mdash;varied, strenuous, responsible
work,&mdash;and for three sturdy years he lived a life
that hardened his muscles, broadened his views,
taught him self-reliance, cheery contentment
with his lot, and, in short, made a man of him.</p>

<p class="indent">He learned to live on a pound a week. He
learned to drink four ale and smoke shag. He
became an <i>habitu√©</i> of those establishments which
are so ably administered by Lord Rowton and
Mr. Lockhart. He obtained an insight into the
workings of the proletariat mind. He learned
the first lesson which all who desire to know
their world must learn, namely, that mankind
is not divided into three classes,&mdash;our own, another
immediately above it, and another immediately
below it,&mdash;but that a motor factory may
contain as many grades and distinctions, as
many social barriers and smart sets, as many
cliques and cabals, as Mayfair&mdash;or Upper Tooting.
He learned to distinguish the stupid, beer-swilling,
illiterate, but mainly honest British
workman of the old-fashioned type from the
precocious, clerkly, unstable, rather weedy product
of the board-school and music-hall. He discovered
earnest young men in blue overalls who
read Ruskin, and pulverised empires and withered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;248]</span>
up dynasties once a week in a debating society.
He made the acquaintance of the paid agitator,
with his stereotyped phrases and glib assertions
of the right of man to a fair day's work and a fair
day's wage, oblivious of the fact that he did not
know the meaning of the first and would never
have been content with the second. He rubbed
shoulders with men who struggled, amid cylinders
and accumulators, with religious doubts; men
who had been "saved," and who insisted on leaving
evidence to that effect, in pamphlet form,
in their mates' coat-pockets; and men who, either
through excess of intellect or from lack of adversity,
had never had any need of God, and consequently
did not believe in Him.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw other things, many of which made him
sick. He saw child-wives of seventeen, tied to
stunted youths of twenty, already inured and
almost indifferent to a thrashing every Saturday
night. He saw babies everywhere, chiefly in
public-houses, where their sole diet appeared to
consist of as much gin as they could lick off the
fingers which accommodating parents from time
to time dipped into their glasses and thrust into
their wailing little mouths. He saw the beast that
a woman can make of a man and the wreck
that a man can make of a woman, and the horror
that drink can make of both; and, being young
and inexperienced, he grew depressed at these
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;249]</span>
sights, and came to the conclusion that the world
was very evil.</p>

<p class="indent">And then he began to notice other things&mdash;the
goodness of the poor to the poor; game
struggles with grinding poverty; incredible cheerfulness
under drab surroundings and in face of
imminent starvation; the loyalty of the wife to
the husband who ill-used her; the good-humoured
resignation of the shrew's husband; the
splendid family pride of the family who, though
they lived in one room, considered very properly
that one room (with rent paid punctually)
constitutes a castle; the whip-round among a
gang of workmen when a mate was laid by and
his whole family rendered destitute; and finally
the children, whom neither dingy courts, nor
crowded alleys, nor want of food, nor occasional
beatings, nor absence of any playthings save tiles,
half-bricks, and dead kittens, could prevent from
running, skipping, shouting, quarrelling, playing
soldiers, keeping shop, and making believe generally,
just as persistently and inconsequently as
their more prosperous little brethren were doing,
much more expensively, not many streets away.
Pip saw all these things, and he began to realise,
as we must all do if we wait long enough, that it
takes all sorts to make a world, and that life is
full of compensations.</p>

<p class="indent">In short, three years of close contact with the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;250]</span>
raw material of humanity gave Pip a deeper
knowledge of man as God made him, than he
could have acquired perhaps from a whole lifetime
spent in contemplating the finished article
in a more highly veneered and less transparent
class of society.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip allowed himself certain relaxations. He
had consented to keep fifty pounds out of Pipette's
hundred and fifty a year, and once a
month, on Saturday afternoons, after a preliminary
scrub and change in his lodging, he departed
to the West End, and indulged in the luxury
of a Turkish bath. (He needed it, as the
heated individual who operated upon him was
wont, with some asperity, to remark.) Then he
dined in state at one of those surprising two-shilling
<i>tables d'h√¥te</i> in a Soho restaurant, and
went on to the play&mdash;the pit. Sometimes he
went to the Oval or Lord's, and with itching arm
watched the cricket. Once he heard a bystander
lament the absence, abroad, of one Wilmot, a
celebrated "left-'ender" ("Terror, my boy! Mike
this lot sit up if 'e was 'ere!"), and he glowed
foolishly to think that he was not forgotten.
Absence abroad was the official explanation of
his non-appearance in first-class cricket during
this period, and also served to satisfy the curiosity
of those of his friends who wanted to know
what had become of him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Sometimes, as he sat in the shilling seats at
Lord's, he wondered if he would ever be able to
use his member's ticket again; and he smiled
when he pictured to himself what the effect would
be if a petrol-scented mechanic were to elbow
his way in and claim a seat in the Old Blues'
reservation!</p>

<p class="indent">He saw no friends but Hanbury, who occasionally
looked him up in his lodging, and with whom
he once went clothed and <i>in propria persona</i> to a
quiet golfing resort during one joyful Christmas
week, when the works were closed from Friday
night till Wednesday morning. He heard regularly
from Pipette. At first she was obviously
miserable, and Pip was at some pains to write
her boisterously cheerful letters about the pleasantness
of his new existence and the enormous
saving of money to be derived from not keeping
up appearances, knowing well that the knowledge
that he was happy would be the first essential in
producing the same condition in Pipette. After
a little she wrote more cheerfully: then followed
a regular year of light, irresponsible,
thoroughly feminine correspondence, full of the
joy of youth and lively appreciation of the scenes
and people around her. Then came a period
when unseeing Pip found her letters rather dull&mdash;a
trifle perfunctory, in fact. Then came a fortnight
during which there was no letter at all, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;252]</span>
Pip grew anxious. Finally, just as he sat down to
write to Mrs. Rossiter inquiring if his sister was
ill, there came a letter,&mdash;a long, breathless, half-shy,
half-rapturous screed,&mdash;containing the absolutely
unprecedented piece of information that
Providence had brought her into contact with the
most splendid fellow&mdash;bracketed with Pip, of
course&mdash;that the world had ever seen; that the
said fellow&mdash;Jim Rossiter&mdash;incredible as it
might appear, had told her that he loved her;
whereupon Pipette had become suddenly conscious
that she loved him; that everybody was
very pleased and kind about it, and&mdash;did Pip
mind?</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who knew Jim Rossiter for a good fellow,
wrote back soberly but heartily. He congratulated
Pipette, gave his unconditional assent to
the match, gratefully declined an invitation to
come and take up his abode with the young
couple after their marriage, and faithfully promised,
whenever that joyful ceremony should take
place, to have a bath and come and give the
bride away. Which brings little Pipette's part
in this narrative to a happy conclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Of Elsie Pip heard little, and tried to think
not at all. At present she was not for him, and
probably never would be. His mind was quite
clear on the subject. When, if ever, his ship
came in, he would seek her out wherever she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;253]</span>
was, and&mdash;provided she had not married some
one else, which was only too likely, Pip thought&mdash;ask
her to marry him. Till then he was a
member of the working classes, and must not
cry for the moon. Still, though he conscientiously
refrained from direct inquiries, he greedily
hoarded every careless item of information
on the subject that cropped up in Pipette's
letters.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie had no parents, and soon after Pip's disappearance
"abroad" had gone for a trip round
the world with Raven Innes and his wife. She
spent some months in India, and Pip, who knew
that that bright jewel of the Empire's crown
contains many men and few women, shuddered
and ground his teeth. However, no bad news
came, and presently he heard from Pipette that
the travellers had left Colombo and were on their
way to Australia. After that Pipette became
engaged, and the curtain fell upon Elsie's movements,
for Pipette's letters now harped upon a
single string, and Pip was far too shy to ask for
information outright. So he hardened his heart,
hoped for the best, and went on with his day's
work, as many a man has had to do before him,
and been all the better for it.</p>

<p class="indent">One sentimental indulgence he allowed himself.
Every Christmas he sent Elsie a present,
together with his best wishes for the season. Only
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;254]</span>
that, and nothing more. No long screed: above
all, no address. He had his pride.</p>

<p class="indent">After two years' work his duties took a more
varied and infinitely pleasanter form. He was
by this time a thoroughly competent workman.
He could take an engine to pieces and put it
together again. He could diagnose every ill that
a motor-car is heir to,&mdash;and a motor-car is more
than human in this respect,&mdash;and he was a fearless
and cool-headed driver. Consequently he
was frequently sent out on trial trips, touring
excursions, and the like; and owing to his excellent
appearance and pleasant manner, was
greatly in request as a teacher. More than one
butterfly of fashion conceived a tenderness in her
worldly and elastic little heart for the big silent
chauffeur, who explained the whole art of motoring
so clearly and quietly, and was never dirty
to look at or familiar to speak to. He grew accustomed&mdash;though
slowly&mdash;to receiving tips,
even from his own former friends and acquaintances,
more than one of whom sat by his side,
and even conversed with him without recognition.
His name was now John Armstrong,&mdash;he
was holding back his own till a more prosperous
time,&mdash;and he had shaved off a mustache of
which, as an undergraduate, he had been secretly
but inordinately proud. These changes, together
with his leather livery and peaked cap, neutralised
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;255]</span>
him down into one of a mere type, and he
looked just like scores of other clean-shaven,
hawk-eyed chauffeurs.</p>

<p class="indent">One day he drove down a roystering party of
cricketers to play a match in the country. When
the game began it was discovered that the visiting
team was a man short. The captain, hard
put to it to find a substitute, cast his eye upon
the chauffeur, and straightway pressed him, a
not unwilling victim, into the service. In black
leather breeches and shirt-sleeves Pip fielded in
the sun, "revolving many memories," as Tennyson
says; and towards the end of the match,
when runs were coming somewhat too freely and
all the bowlers had been tried in vain, was given
the ball; whereupon, throwing caution to the
winds, he disposed of five wickets in exactly
three overs. Fortunately the team had lunched
generously, as teams that come down from the
city for a day's sport not infrequently do, so
the enthusiasm which Pip's feat evoked was too
alcoholic to be discriminating.</p>

<p class="indent">One more experience Pip had, and as it marked
the closing stages of his apprenticeship to manhood,
and also introduced him to a character
whose existence was foreshadowed in the second
chapter of this book, it shall be set down at
length.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_9" id="CHAPTER_9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE PRINCIPAL BOY: AN INTERLUDE</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Captain Lottingar</span> opened the door of the
library and roared up the staircase&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Lottie!"</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Lottie Lottingar came down. She was
an exceedingly handsome young person,&mdash;what
is usually known as "a fine figure of a woman,"&mdash;but
there was nothing of the squire's daughter
about her, as there should be about a youthful
<i>ch√¢telaine</i> who comes tripping down the shallow
oak stairs of a great Elizabethan country house.
There is usually something breezy, healthy, and
eminently English about such a girl. Lottie,
although her colour was good and her costume
countrified enough, smacked of the town. She
was undeniably attractive, but in her present
surroundings she somehow suggested a bottle of
champagne at a school-treat. She would have
made an admirable "Principal Boy" in a pantomime.
As a matter of fact, she had been one.</p>

<p class="indent">Her father led the way into the library, and
having shut the door, lit a cigarette and leaned
against the carved mantelpiece. Lottie sat on
a table and swung her legs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;257]</span>
"Where's the Honourable?" inquired the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Out," said Lottie tersely.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know that. Where?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Plantations."</p>

<p class="indent">"What's he after?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Shrimps, I expect," said Miss Lottingar flippantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"That will do. We're talking business just
now. Showing any signs yet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lots."</p>

<p class="indent">"When will he come to the scratch?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pretty soon, if you and your pals don't mess
things."</p>

<p class="indent">The gallant captain's brow lowered.</p>

<p class="indent">"None of your lip, my girl!" he remarked.
"What do you mean&mdash;mess things?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean that you'll have to play carefully if
you aren't going to scare him away."</p>

<p class="indent">"Scare him? How?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you and the others are a bit out of
your depth in this affair. I'll do you the justice,
Dad, to admit that in the ordinary way of business
you are a hard nut to crack; but coming the
country gentleman over a man who, though
he's a mug, <i>is</i> a country gentleman, is rather
more of a job than your lot can manage comfortably.
Look at Jerry!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What's wrong with Jerry?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;258]</span>
"Him? It's the first time he's played at
being a gamekeeper, and he doesn't know the rules,
that's all."</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you know?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Honourable told me. Said it wasn't his
business, of course, but he was afraid my father
had got hold of a thoroughly incompetent keeper,
and perhaps he ought to be told so&mdash;haw!"</p>

<p class="indent">The captain snorted.</p>

<p class="indent">"What did you say?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"I advised him," replied his daughter, smiling
indulgently, "not to mention it. I said you
were rather fond of your own judgment in some
things, and might be offended."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Jerry does his best," said Lottingar;
"but you are right, Lottie, for all that. He'll
muck things. You must keep the young fool
out of his way. Can't you take him out for
walks, or something?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Walks? What excitement!" Miss Lottingar
cast up her eyes pathetically.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you can go motoring with him as soon
as we get a chauffeur. That's what I wanted to
see you about."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who is the chauffeur? One of the&mdash;one of
your friends?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, worse luck! Every man I can trust is
in this business already. We must make shift
with some absolutely straight fool."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;259]</span>
"That'll be a pleasant change," remarked
Miss Lottingar.</p>

<p class="indent">"It will be all right in the long run," continued
her father. "He need never suspect anything.
We can keep him mowing the grass or
something during his spare time. And if you
can't bring off that proposal within a week, my
girl," he concluded, throwing his cigarette into
the grate, "you're not the sort I took you
for."</p>

<p class="indent">"Give me the motor; I'll do the rest," said
Miss Lottie, quite undisturbed by this direct
reference to her virgin affections.</p>

<p class="indent">"And for the Lord's sake be quick about it!
The expense of all this flummery is something
cruel. There'll be nothing left to divide when
it's all over if you can't&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"There's somebody coming up the drive," said
Lottie, who was gazing indifferently out of the
window.</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later the door was opened by
the captain's butler, an elderly gentleman of
benevolent appearance. A student of physiognomy
would have put him down as a rather eccentric
and easily-imposed-upon philanthropist.
(He had made his living almost exclusively out
of this fact for the past thirty years.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Young feller to see you, Cap," he announced,
having first satisfied himself that, saving the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;260]</span>
presence of the Principal Boy, his employer was
alone.</p>

<p class="indent">"About the motor?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Show him in."</p>

<p class="indent">The butler retired, and presently returned,
ushering a young man, squarely built and black
of hair, with serious blue eyes and a healthy
brown face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I came to see if you were still in want of a
chauffeur, sir," he said in reply to the captain's
interrogation. "I have been employed at the
Gresley works."</p>

<p class="indent">"I do want a chauffeur" replied the warrior
on the hearthrug; "but how am I to know that
you will do, my man?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you care to go and put any part of the
machinery out of order, I will undertake to put
it right again; and after that I could take you
for a run in the car."</p>

<p class="indent">This sounded direct and business-like, and
pleased the captain, and, incidentally, the
captain's daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, that's fair enough. Go and have something
to eat now, and after that you can take
Miss Lottingar and myself for a spin. By the
way, what's your name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"John Armstrong&mdash;sir!" said Pip. (He was
always forgetting that word.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;261]</span>
"Have you any references?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Could you get any?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I might, but I'd rather not."</p>

<p class="indent">The captain regarded this blunt young man
curiously. He possessed no references himself,
and he moved in a class of society where such
things were regarded with pious horror. Pip
rather attracted him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind them at present," he said, ringing
the bell. "If you can handle the car you will
suit me. If you can't, you are worth nothing, and
you'll get nothing. Would you be willing to do
odd jobs as well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly."</p>

<p class="indent">The butler appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">"Howard," said the captain, "take this man
and give him something to eat in the steward's
room, and let me see him again at three o'clock."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Howard, looking particularly benevolent,
led Pip away, and Captain Lottingar was left
alone with his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">"He'll do, Lottie, I think," he said carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">"M' yes&mdash;he'll do," said Lottie.</p>

<p class="indent">Her father turned round.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't seem quite sure. What is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing. I'm sure enough. Take him."</p>

<p class="indent">So the bargain was concluded, and Pip found
himself engaged as chauffeur to Captain Cuthbert
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;262]</span>
Lottingar (regiment unknown), of Broadoak
Manor, Great Stileborough, Herts.</p>

<p class="indent">But Lottie was not sure. She had observed
one fact which had escaped her usually astute
parent, and that was that the new chauffeur was
a gentleman&mdash;and, as such, a suspicious character.
An ordinary mechanical mechanic would
have been harmless; but a gentleman was a
superfluity, and therefore a source of danger.
But Lottie hesitated to comment on the fact.
Wisdom said, "Take no risks"; feminine curiosity
said, "Chance it!" Lottie chanced it, not
for the first time in the history of womankind.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">However dubious the impression which the
new chauffeur had made upon Miss Lottingar,
it is only fair to state that the impression made
by Miss Lottingar and her gallant papa upon
the new chauffeur was more dubious still. Pip,
who was not an expert where women were concerned,&mdash;only
an enthusiastic amateur,&mdash;made
a mental note that Lottie "looked a good sort,
and was a rare pretty girl." Being less biassed
and more experienced in regard to his own sex,
he was nearer the mark in his estimate of her
father. The fact that Lottie's complexion was
not entirely her own was unrevealed to him, but
he did not fail to write down Captain Lottingar
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;263]</span>
as a "bounder." He observed that his employer,
though he carefully pronounced "here" "heah,"
not infrequently called "nothing" "nothink";
and Pip still possessed enough regard for the
fetishes of his youth to be conscious of a thrill
of positive horror at the spectacle of a man who
wore brown boots with a top-hat on Sunday.</p>

<p class="indent">Various guests visited Broadoak,&mdash;gentlemen
with waxed mustaches and loud garments,&mdash;most
of whom appeared to be intimate friends
of Lottie's. They shot Captain Lottingar's
rabbits by day, with indifferent success, and played
cards most of the night. Much the most interesting
of the guests, however, was the gentleman
heretofore referred to as "the Honourable." He
was more than a guest at Broadoak,&mdash;he was
almost one of the family. Captain Lottingar
slapped him on the back and called him "my
boy"; Captain Lottingar's friends addressed him
with admiring deference and borrowed money
from him; and Miss Lottingar behaved to him
in a manner which left no doubt in the minds of
casual observers as to the state of her affections.</p>

<p class="indent">The Honourable himself was a pleasant but dissipated-looking
youth of about two-and-twenty.
His stature was small, and his attainments, beyond
those indigenous to every well-born and
well-bred young Englishman, insignificant; but
his appreciation of the pleasures of life was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;264]</span>
great. He was a good specimen of that type of
young man but for whom chorus-girls would
be compelled to pay for their own diamonds.
Pending the arrival of the time when he would be
called upon to assume the office of an hereditary
legislator, he was engaged in what he called "seeing
life." He did not see much, though he
thought he did, for his field of vision was limited;
but what he saw he saw thoroughly. He entertained
a great admiration for Captain Lottingar,
whom he had encountered at a flashy club in
town; and any fleeting doubts, derived from the
hints of experienced and officious friends, which
he might have entertained as to the genuineness
of that warrior's pretensions to gentility were at
once set at rest when he arrived, in response to a
pressing invitation, on a visit to "my old place in
Hertfordshire." A ripening friendship with the
Principal Boy was now turning his admiration
for the name of Lottingar into positive infatuation;
and altogether the Honourable Reginald
Fitznorton was in that condition usually described
as "ready for plucking."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who did not as a rule concern himself overmuch
with his neighbours' affairs, soon became
conscious of a distinct feeling of curiosity in
regard to his present surroundings. Captain Lottingar
one day mentioned to the Honourable in
his hearing that the family of Lottingar had inhabited
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;265]</span>
Broadoak Manor, without intermission,
from the days of Queen Elizabeth,&mdash;a statement
which Pip found rather hard to reconcile
with the fact that there lay in the garage at the
back of the house a notice-board, showing every
sign of having been recently uprooted from the
grassplot by the front gate, inscribed with the
simple legend "<span class="smcap">To Let.</span>" Moreover, one afternoon,
while exploring the numerous passages in
the house in search of the Principal Boy's fox-terrier,
which he had been bidden to catch and
wash, Pip made the discovery that, with the exception
of the dining-room, library, kitchens, hall
and a few bedrooms, Broadoak Manor was a warren
of empty rooms destitute of furniture,
though a few of the more conspicuous windows
were furnished with curtains.</p>

<p class="indent">His fellow-menials also were a curiosity-inspiring
crew. The establishment, besides Howard,
consisted of a not unattractive middle-aged
female who cooked; a beetle-browed individual
named Briggs, the keeper, who, though inclined
to be reticent on matters connected with that
exotic biped, the pheasant, was a mine of information
on worldly topics, and a perfect encyclop√¶dia
of reference in regard to horse-racing;
and a pretty but pert maid, who made eyes at
Pip, and once, in a moment of inadvertence, addressed
the saintly Howard as "Pa." All were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;266]</span>
on the best of terms, and sat down to poker in
the evening with a regularity and cheerfulness
which convinced the inexperienced Pip either
that servants' halls were not what he had imagined
them to be, or that adversity had landed
him in a very shady establishment.</p>

<p class="indent">However, he discovered one refreshing and self-evident
truth in this home of mystery. There
was no doubting the fact that the Honourable's
courtship of Miss Lottingar (or Miss Lottingar's
courtship of the Honourable, if you happened to
live on the other side of the curtain) was fast
maturing to a definite conclusion. On numerous
motor excursions Pip found himself compelled to
combine with his duties as chauffeur the highly
necessary but embarrassing r√¥le of gooseberry.
Occasionally Miss Lottingar attempted to drive
the car herself, but as a rule Pip had entire charge,
the young people sitting together in close companionship
in the tonneau behind. Occasionally
the car would be stopped, and Pip would be
kindly bidden to smoke his pipe, what time the
Honourable escorted Miss Lottingar into a neighbouring
plantation, to watch hypothetical pheasants
feeding; or Miss Lottingar took the Honourable
up a by-path, to show him a view which had
sprung into existence within the last five minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, simple soul, knew nothing and cared less
about the gentle art of husband-hunting. He
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;267]</span>
felt himself irresistibly drawn towards this young
couple. He abandoned himself to sentimental
sympathy, and drove his car or smoked his pipe
with his eyes fixed resolutely before him, thinking
of Elsie and wondering if his own turn would ever
come.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, as they were returning from a long
afternoon's spin, the car suddenly slowed down
to a stop, and with the complete and maddening
finality of its kind refused to move another inch.
Pip divested himself of his coat and disappeared
beneath the vehicle, emerging after a brief supine
scrutiny to announce that the necessary repairs
would involve the assistance of a blacksmith and
take an hour and a half to execute. The couple
received this announcement with marked composure,
and left Pip to wrestle with the car,
merely bidding him call for them at the "George"
at Lindley, two miles ahead, on his way home.</p>

<p class="indent">It was dark by the time that the united efforts
of Pip and the blacksmith restored the car to a
state of kinetic energy, and it was more than two
hours before Pip called at the "George" for his
passengers. They climbed swiftly into the tonneau,
and the car proceeded on its way. His
charges were unusually silent, and Pip, turning
suddenly to ask for a direction, surprised the
Honourable in the act of kissing the Principal
Boy's hands.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;268]</span>
The Honourable departed next morning for
London. In the afternoon the car was ordered
round, and Miss Lottie announced her intention
of receiving a driving-lesson. Pip instructed her
to the best of his ability, and by constant vigilance
and the occasional intervention of Providence
succeeded in indefinitely prolonging the
span of life of two old women, one cow, seven
children, and innumerable cocks and hens.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently it began to rain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind about putting up the hood,
Armstrong," said Lottie. "It's a rotten affair&mdash;keeps
no rain out. Let's run under those thick
trees over there."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip took the wheel, and the car slid up a narrow
lane and came to anchor under the thickest
part of an arching grove of chestnuts.</p>

<p class="indent">"There," said the Principal Boy, removing her
gloves, "I feel regularly done up. My hands are
all of a shake after that beastly wheel. Am I
improving?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are a good deal steadier than you were&mdash;Miss,"
said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's all right. Much obliged for your help.
You're a good sort, Armstrong."</p>

<p class="indent">"Armstrong" turned extremely pink.</p>

<p class="indent">"Look here," continued Lottie breezily, "I'm
tired of calling you Armstrong. What's your
name?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;269]</span>
"Er&mdash;John."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right-o! I shall call you Jack. And now,
Jack, I want to ask you something. What are
you doing driving a motor-car?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Jack" regarded his mistress with some apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why shouldn't I drive a motor-car?" he
asked, rather defiantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why? Because you're a gentleman. Bless
you, dear boy, do you think I didn't spot that
long ago? What was it&mdash;debts?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Debts" seemed to meet the requirements
of the situation without unduly straining the
truth, so Pip nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" said Miss Lottingar sympathetically;
"I know. We have been that way all our lives
in our family."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip thought of Broadoak Manor and its present
proprietor, and felt no surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dad has lived on his wits ever since I can
remember," continued Miss Lottingar. "I suppose
you see what sort of a customer he is?" she
added, in a sudden burst of candour.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip nodded again. "I think I do," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"He's a game old chap, is Dad," continued the
dutiful daughter, "but he's on the lowest peg
at present. However, I landed the Honourable
last night, so things ought to look up now."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who regarded the love of a man for a maid
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;270]</span>
as something rather more sacred than honour
itself, fairly gasped at this offhand remark.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean&mdash;you are engaged to him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said the Principal Boy in a matter-of-fact
tone. "He asked me last night at the
'George,' when you were tinkering at the car."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! Congratulations!" said Pip awkwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks. But all the hard work has to come
yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We've landed him. Now we have to skin
him!"</p>

<p class="indent">After this somewhat unfeeling reference to
her intended, Miss Lottie sat silent, evidently
wondering whether her sudden liking for the
quiet chauffeur had not caused her to be a little
indiscreet.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Pip said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose he has gone to London to tell his
father?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Earl? Not much. I made Fitz promise
to avoid the old man till I gave him leave. He
has gone up to town for the engagement ring.
When he gets back to-morrow he is going to
write and tell him everything. That will bring
his lordship down here double-quick, and we'll
settle everything in one fair, square, up-and-down
scrap." Miss Lottingar almost smacked her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will the Earl object, then?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;271]</span>
"Object? My dear boy, look at me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip looked. He saw a pair of bold black eyes,
a very red and entrancing mouth, a <i>retrouss√©</i>
nose, an alluringly dimpled chin, and a good
deal of glinting coppery hair. Individually these
features were distinctly attractive, but there
was something about the <i>tout ensemble</i> that supplied
an immediate answer to the owner's extremely
frank question.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll know me again," said Miss Lottingar,
rather faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Beg your pardon," said Pip, ungluing his
gaze with a jerk. "Bad habit I've got. Yes,
perhaps he will object."</p>

<p class="indent">"I should think so. 'Fast girl&mdash;shady father&mdash;with
all their goods in the shop window!'
That's what the old man will see, if he's the
least bit less of a fool than his son."</p>

<p class="indent">"But," said Pip, "won't he consent if he sees
that you really&mdash;care for each other?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Afraid he won't see that," said Miss Lottingar
composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip stared.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mean you don't really care for Fitznorton
at all?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear boy, have you <i>seen</i> him?" inquired
Lottie plaintively.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. But&mdash;why on earth are you going to
marry him?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;272]</span>
"I'm not quite certain that I am," said the
Principal Boy coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you said you were."</p>

<p class="indent">"I said I was engaged to him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorry! I had an idea it was the same thing,"
said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Lottie gazed at him, not without a certain
admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not quite," she said. "You're a simple old
chap, Jack, but I like you for it; so I'll tell
you what we are going to do. When the Earl
comes down here&mdash;the day after to-morrow,
I expect&mdash;Dad and I will interview him. Fitz
won't be there: I shall send him out into the
woods to chase rabbits. Then we shall point out
to the old dear that if the engagement is not
permitted my heart will be broken."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You see?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I begin to. What will it cost to repair it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A hundred thousand pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">"You value your heart at rather a high figure."</p>

<p class="indent">"He can afford the money: it's a mere fleabite
to him. He is one of the richest men in
England."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If he agrees, I sign a paper renouncing all
claim to Fitz. The Earl writes a cheque, takes
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;273]</span>
Fitz home in a bandbox, and Dad is on his legs
again. That's all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Suppose the Earl doesn't agree?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He will. It will be a pill for him, but he
doesn't want the family name dragged through
the law courts."</p>

<p class="indent">"But suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, if he does, we are ready for him. If he
ab-so-lute-ly refuses, I go to the front door,
whistle up Fitz, pop him into this motor, skim
off to Lindley, and get married by special licence.
Fitz has agreed, and has the licence in his pocket
now. Then I shall have an even stronger card
to play&mdash;do you see?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Afraid not. Too deep for me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, once we're legally married, the old
chap will find that as a real wife I am far more
expensive to get rid of than before."</p>

<p class="indent">"Get rid of?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. He wouldn't think of admitting <i>me</i> to
his almighty family circle. He would have to ask
now what I would take to live apart from Fitz."</p>

<p class="indent">"Live apart?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"And you'd agree?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For two hundred thousand&mdash;yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"My word! You'd leave your husband?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. You don't suppose I want to spend all my days
with an image like Fitz, do you?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;274]</span>
Lottie threw herself back petulantly in her
seat. Presently Pip laid his hand on her arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't!" said he.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't be drawn into this affair."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not? Seems to me I'm in it pretty
thick already."</p>

<p class="indent">"You could break it off&mdash;at once. It would
be the kindest thing to do."</p>

<p class="indent">"It would be a blamed silly thing to do," said
Miss Lottingar frankly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you care for him at all?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fitz? Not a rap."</p>

<p class="indent">"But&mdash;do you like him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes! He's a decent little sort."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, just think what it would mean to him
if he married you, and then&mdash;found out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Um!" said Miss Lottie thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Besides," continued Pip, following up his
advantage, "think of yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">"I usually do," said Lottie.</p>

<p class="indent">"Women were never meant for that low-down
sort of game," said Pip, getting to the heart of
his subject.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Lottie blazed out.</p>

<p class="indent">"There you go! Women, women, women!
I wonder if there was ever a man in this world
that could treat a woman sensibly. Some men&mdash;most men&mdash;look
upon women as fair game,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;275]</span>
and treat them accordingly. The others&mdash;men
like you&mdash;look on them as little pot angels, and
shudder when they show they are made of flesh
and blood. Women are human beings, no better
and no worse than men, only they don't get the
chances men do, Jack. That's all&mdash;human beings!
Remember that."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a hard world for women, I know," said
Pip, rather staggered by this outburst. "But
some good chap is bound to come along and&mdash;er&mdash;make
you happy, and all that. Hasn't
there ever been&mdash;anybody of that kind?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lots."</p>

<p class="indent">"None you cared about, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not one. Well, there was one. Jim Lister
is his name. He is assistant stage-manager at
the Crown Theatre."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" said Pip hopefully.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I liked him well enough, but we should
always have been poor&mdash;awfully poor&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"If a couple are really fond of each other,
nothing else matters a damn," said Pip, with
conviction. "Sorry! I mean you might do
worse."</p>

<p class="indent">Lottie rounded on him.</p>

<p class="indent">"There you go again. 'Might do worse!' 'Be
thankful for small mercies!' It's a rotten game
being a woman, Jack. You are a man and can't
understand. But if you'd had as hard a time as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;276]</span>
I have,&mdash;yes, and if you'd seen half as much
of this world as I have,&mdash;you'd be gentler with
me, Jack."</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly the conversation was taking an unexpected
turn. Pip was completely out of his
depth. Ten minutes ago he had been a respectful
chauffeur, teaching a rather flamboyant
young mistress how to drive a car. Now he was
sitting by the selfsame young mistress, holding
her arm in a friendly fashion, and talking to her
as an elder brother might talk to a petulant
child.</p>

<p class="indent">The irregularity of the situation apparently
struck Miss Lottingar at the same moment, for,
with one of those swift and characteristically
feminine changes of mood which leave mere man
toiling helplessly behind in the trammels of logical
consistency, she abruptly released her arm,
observed brightly that the rain had ceased,
wondered if it wouldn't turn out a fine evening after
all, and bade Armstrong drive home as fast as
possible.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="indent">The Honourable Reginald Fitznorton was due
back at four o'clock next afternoon. The motor
was ordered round, and Pip drove Lottie to the
station to meet him. Lottie, who was looking
pale and not quite herself, declined to sit in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;277]</span>
tonneau, and accompanied Pip on the front seat.
In spite of the facilities for conversation afforded
by this position she said little; and Pip, whose
repertory of conversational openings was not extensive,
said nothing at all. Besides, he was not
certain whether he was to be treated to-day as
a big brother or as a chauffeur.</p>

<p class="indent">Had he been a more observant big brother or
a less diligent chauffeur he might have noticed
that from time to time he was being favoured
by his mistress with a sidelong scrutiny of some
intensity. Being Pip, he saw nothing. One act
of hers might have afforded him a good deal of
information had he desired it. When the car,
which had started late, rounded the last corner
on the way to the station, there appeared in the
offing no less a person than the Honourable himself,
bag in hand, and diffusing happiness around
him. Suddenly Pip became conscious of something.
The girl at his side seemed to shrink up
to him, and for a moment her hand travelled
towards his as if for protection. An instant
later she was leaning back in her seat, smilingly
dipping an answering pennant to the frenzied
signals of her rapidly approaching swain.</p>

<p class="indent">The car slowed down to a stop. Miss Lottingar
stepped out, and was received by her enraptured lover,
regardless of Pip's presence,
with a smacking salute that fairly drowned the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;278]</span>
noise of the engine. After that the happy couple
entered the tonneau, and Pip, with eyes rigidly
turned to the front, heard little and saw nothing
of them throughout the drive home.</p>

<p class="indent">As the Principal Boy had confidently predicted,
the Right Honourable the Earl of Cartavon arrived
at Broadoak Manor at lunch-time next day.
The inmates of that venerable pile were ready
for him. Howard, looking like a retired archbishop,
received him at the door, and Captain
Lottingar, in tweeds and gaiters, greeted him in
the library. His lordship was affably informed
that, in consequence of recent surprising and joyful
disclosures by the young folk, his visit was not
altogether unexpected; and that if he would join
the house-party at luncheon, the business on
which he had come down might be comfortably
discussed over a cigar in the library afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">This much was retailed in the servants' hall
by Howard, whose well-formed ears had missed
little or nothing of the dialogue in the library,
even in a filtered form. Mr. Briggs opined, amid
general approval, that "the Captain and the gal
between them could bleed the old toff proper."</p>

<p class="indent">After lunch the Honourable emerged from the
front door, armed only with a walking-stick, and
set out briskly, apparently on a country walk.
At the same time word was sent to Pip that
the motor would be required at three.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;279]</span>
Punctually to time he ran the car up the
broad avenue, passing the library windows on the
way. He was conscious of a group of three round
the fire,&mdash;it was a chilly day in late September,&mdash;and
he wondered how the process of bleeding
was getting on.</p>

<p class="indent">The car and its driver stood before the front
door for more than an hour. It was after four
when the front door suddenly opened, and Lottie,
banging it behind her, hurriedly descended the
steps. She slipped up beside Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Start off," she said&mdash;"quick!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip got down and set the engine going.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where to?" he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">"Anywhere!" said Lottie in a choking voice,
"anywhere! But get started."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip sprang up into his place and took the
wheel. The great car ceased vibrating and began
to creep forward. Suddenly it gave a mighty
plunge, and sped down the avenue.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same moment Captain Lottingar, looking
anything but a country gentleman, and furiously
angry, threw open the library window and
bawled to Pip to stop. But the louder he bawled
and the more thoroughly he blasphemed the
faster the car shot down the drive.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Cartavon sat stiffly in a high-backed
chair by the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shouldn't trouble if I were you, Captain&mdash;er&mdash;Lottingar,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;280]</span>
he said. "She won't come
back."</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Lottingar banged down the window,
and, returning to his favourite position on the
hearthrug, summed up his daughter's character
in terms which would have been excessive if
applied to Jezebel herself.</p>

<p class="indent">The Earl stood up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir," he said, "I am obliged to you for your
hospitality. I will walk to the station now, and
catch the five-thirty train back to town. I presume,
after what has just happened, that we may
regard this incident as closed. And let me tell
you, Mr. Lottingar," the old gentleman added,
turning on his heel as he opened the door, "that
Miss Lottingar is a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight too good a
daughter for such a shark as yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">After he had gone, Captain Lottingar kicked a
valuable Japanese fire-screen (for which he had
not paid) round the room.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="indent">On clearing the lodge-gates Pip turned the
car to the left, and they spun down the London
road. For an hour they travelled, sometimes
slowing through a village or changing gear up
a hill, but usually running at top speed, rolling
up the miles like shavings under a jack-plane.
Pip sat gripping his wheel, intent on his work.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;281]</span>
Lottie, rigid and upright beside him, looked
straight before her, with her hands clasped tightly
together under the rug. Occasionally she cast
a sidelong glance at her silent companion.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, when they had covered nearly thirty
miles, Lottie spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"Jack, I want to talk to you. Stop this
machine in some quiet place. That beastly
engine makes too much noise for me."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, who was getting used to these wayside
halts, ran the car up the next opening and
stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the two turned and regarded each other.
A glance apprised Pip of the fact that he was to
be big brother again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Jack, I've done it this time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Done what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Upset the apple-cart. Poor old Dad! But
I'd do it again!"</p>

<p class="indent">"How did you do it the first time?" said Pip
patiently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I'll tell you. After lunch, Dad and I
and his lordship went into the library. We all
sat down, the old gentleman very stiff and upright.
He had hardly given me a glance so far,
but now he turned and looked at me. I felt
pretty small, Jack. I can hold my own in a staring
match with most people, but that proud old
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;282]</span>
man fairly beat me. He simply looked right
through me at the cushion my head was leaning
against. By the way, you can do that a bit,
too, Jack. It's a trick some men have. That's
what first made me think that you&mdash;where
was I?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In the library."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, yes. Well, at last the old man turned to
Dad, and looked at <i>him</i>. Dad didn't half like it,
I could see. The old man said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'I understand that my son proposes to ally
himself with&mdash;er,&mdash;this young lady?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Yes,' said Dad, 'he does.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And you have given your consent to the
match?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Yes', says Dad, as solemn as a judge; 'after
due consideration, I have.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then I may as well tell you at once,' says
his lordship, quite briskly, 'that I am utterly and
entirely opposed to the match, and will never
give my consent to it.'</p>

<p class="indent">"There was a little silence, and we all three
settled down in our chairs as much as to say,
'Now we are really getting to business.' Presently
Dad said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'I am afraid, my lord, that solemn agreements
of this kind are not so easily broken. Consider
my daughter's feelings.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I am perfectly willing to consider her feelings,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;283]</span>
sir,' says the old gentleman, with a little
odd bow. Then he turned to me and said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'May I ask a direct question? Are you genuinely
attached to my son?'</p>

<p class="indent">"I wished he wouldn't keep on at me like that.
However, I had to keep my end up, so I said, in
a sort of soft voice, 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ah,' said he, as if he was thinking. Then
Dad, evidently considering we were wasting time,
put in,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'If this match is broken off, my daughter's
susceptibilities must be solaced in a very substantial
manner.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Then the old gentleman turned and looked
Dad through and through, and said, 'Ah!' again,
as much as to say, 'I thought so.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Well,' he said at last, 'how much do you
want?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>I</i>?' says Dad, still playing the game&mdash;'nothing.
<i>I</i> am not the injured party. It is for
my poor girl to say.'</p>

<p class="indent">"The Earl looked at me. I took a big breath,
and said, 'A hundred thousand pounds.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'You value your heart at rather a high
figure, madam,' says he. (Do you remember,
those were the very words <i>you</i> used to me,
Jack?) Then he swings round to Dad, and
says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'Of course this is preposterous. I am willing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;284]</span>
to pay you five thousand pounds, to extricate my
son from the trap, the carefully baited trap'&mdash;he
looked all round the room, and I <i>knew</i> he
knew everything in it had been got on the nod&mdash;'into
which he has fallen. That is more than you
would get out of the most impressionable jury,
and I advise you to take it, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Lottingar.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Quite true, my lord,' says Dad. 'But you
know you'd give more than a hundred thousand
to keep the family name out of the courts. You
don't want the papers to get hold of it. "A
Cabinet Minister's son sued for Breach-of-Promise"&mdash;you
know the sort of stuff&mdash;and
Lottie's portrait in "The Sketch."'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I am afraid we are wasting time, Mr. Lottingar,'
says his lordship. 'If your daughter will
sign a document, which I will draw up for her,
renouncing all claims to my son, and undertaking
not to molest him for the future, I will give her
a cheque for five thousand pounds. If not, I
must bid you good-afternoon.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'A hundred thousand!' says Dad.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I think you are acting foolishly,' says the
old man, getting up. 'If you refuse my offer I
shall go up to town now, and call on my solicitor
to-morrow morning; and I think it highly probable,
from what I see of your surroundings here,
and from what I know of your antecedents already,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;285]</span>
that I shall be able to make it exceedingly
risky for you to face the publicity of the law
courts in any capacity whatsoever. In fact, I
should not be surprised if you had to leave the
country.'</p>

<p class="indent">"My word, Jack, he was fine! He dropped
each word out of his mouth like a little lump
of ice. But old Dad stood up to him. He simply
chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">"'No, no, my lord, it won't do,' he said. 'I
have laid my plans farther ahead than you think.
Now, look here. If you don't sign that little
cheque I'm asking for, Lottie here will walk
straight out of this house, take her motor, pick
up your son, who is waiting for her at the roadside
this minute, and drive straight to Lindley,
where they will be married by special licence this
very afternoon. Your son has got that licence
in his pocket now. And when the two are firmly
tied up, you'll realise two things, my lord,&mdash;first,
that it's hardly the thing to rake up the past
life of your daughter-in-law's father; and secondly,
that a wife is a deal more expensive to buy
off than a <i>fianc√©e</i>.'</p>

<p class="indent">"After that there was a <i>very</i> long pause. Dad
was top dog again, and the old Earl was thinking it out.
Suddenly he turned to me. He said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'You say my son has a special licence in his
pocket?'</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;286]</span>
"'Yes,' I said.</p>

<p class="indent">"'And you have asked him to wait by the
roadside for you this afternoon, in case of&mdash;contingencies?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Yes.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'You must possess great influence over him.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'She does,' says Dad, before any one else
could speak.</p>

<p class="indent">"The old man took not the slightest notice,
but went on talking to me.</p>

<p class="indent">"'If you married my son you would demand
a large sum&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Two hundred thousand quid,' says Dad.</p>

<p class="indent">"'You would demand a large sum,' goes on the
Earl, acting as if he and I were alone together,
'as a condition of your living apart from him and
refraining from molesting him. Would you?'</p>

<p class="indent">"The words began to stick in my throat a bit,
but I said, 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I think,' he went on, 'that you told me just
now that you were deeply attached to my son?'</p>

<p class="indent">"This time I just nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then you mean to say,' he says, looking at
me in a way that simply made me feel faint, 'that
you would marry a young man whom you profess
to love, and, having blackmailed him to the
fullest possible extent, would readily consent to
live apart from him, leaving him prevented by
the law of the land from ever taking a wife of his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;287]</span>
own station and fulfilling his duty to society and
posterity, so long as you remained alive? For the
sake of a sum of money you would deliberately
wreck the life of a foolish but good-hearted young
man, who has paid you the highest honour that a
man can pay a woman; and with his life you
would wreck the fortunes of an ancient and honourable
house? Would you do that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"His face was like iron, Jack, but there were
tears in his eyes. I sat gripping the arms of my
chair. Suddenly Dad struck in,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'Come, come, my lord! you are simply wasting
words. Which is it to be? Will you settle
this matter, or must Lottie take the final step?'</p>

<p class="indent">"The old man said nothing, but looked at me.
And then suddenly I found my voice. I boiled
over, for I had realised at last what an awful
thing I was going to do&mdash;awful for him, and
awful for me. Somehow I didn't feel as if I could
back Dad any longer. It flashed across me what
I had been trying to do&mdash;sell myself! I'm not a
great saint, Jack, but, thank God! I realised in
time that there are things in this world that
money can't buy. I just stood up and said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'Dad, it's no good. I simply won't do this. I
can't think why I ever consented. I'm sorry.
I've always backed you up to now; but I'm a
decent girl after all, and I <i>won't</i> do this&mdash;I
<i>won't</i>, I <i>won't</i>.'</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;288]</span>
"Then I sat down and cried a bit. Dad looked
perfectly flummoxed. In a minute I had dried my
eyes, and I said to the old lord,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"'Lord Cartavon, I wouldn't marry your son
if you begged me on your knees. I won't marry
a man I don't love, so I won't marry <i>him</i>. Keep
your cheque-book in your pocket. I renounce all
claims to him&mdash;there!'"</p>

<p class="indent">Lottie's voice broke at last.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well done!" said Pip softly.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's just what the old lord said," exclaimed
the girl, turning a surprised look upon him. "You
both seem to have the same feelings."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what happened next?" inquired Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Things were a bit mixed after that," said
Lottie, not without relish. "There was a great
roar like thunder, and Dad dashed across the
room at me. He was in an awful passion. He
nearly killed me once, when he&mdash;never mind
that. But the old Earl just stepped in front of
him and said, 'Gently, sir, gently! there is a lady
present.' Then he went quickly to the door and
opened it, and gave me a little nod to go. All the
time he was holding Dad's arm with his other
hand. I walked out, and the old man bowed to
me as I passed, and said, very gently, 'God bless
you, young lady!' He said that&mdash;to me!" she
reiterated proudly, turning a pair of shining eyes
on Pip. "Then he closed it behind me just as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;289]</span>
Dad broke into another roar. I rushed out of the
house, hopped on to the car, and here we are!"</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="indent">"And what are you going to do now?" inquired
practical Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know, I daren't go back. Dad
would kill me."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl shuddered, and turned to Pip appealingly,
as a woman, however strong her will may
be, always turns to a man she knows she can
trust.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip reflected in his deliberate fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">"You had better go to London," he said at
last. "You know your way about there, I expect.
I think you should go on the stage again. You
like it, and it will make you independent. I
suppose you can get an engagement?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I can manage that," said the Principal
Boy. "Drive on now, Jack, and take me to
Hunsford Station. It can't be more than a mile
or two from here."</p>

<p class="indent">Once more the car sped through the gathering
darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll go round to the 'Crown,'" continued Lottie
more briskly, "first thing to-morrow morning.
Jim Lister will get me a shop of some sort, if it's
only in the chorus. That'll do to go on with."</p>

<p class="indent">"He must be a good chap," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;290]</span>
"He is," said Lottie warmly.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they reached the little station.
Inquiries elicited the news that there would be
a train for London in half an hour.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll stay with you till it starts," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">He ran the car under a wall out of the wind,
and continued talking. He was in an unusually
communicative mood, for him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was wondering," he said, "why your feelings
changed so suddenly in that interview, after
you had quite made up your mind to&mdash;for the
other thing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't know, I'm sure," said Lottie. "I
can't think now what made me agree to the idea,
even for a moment. Jack, would you have
thought <i>very</i> badly of me if&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I think I know what it was," continued Pip,
who had been following his own train of thought;
"you must have been kee&mdash;fond of somebody
else all the time, fonder than you really knew,
and when the critical moment came, the thought
of&mdash;of him, though you didn't know it, prevented
you from making yourself cheap. Is that
it? Don't answer if it isn't a fair question."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Jack, it's a fair question."</p>

<p class="indent">"And am I right?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence. Pip saw a rather strange
look settle on the girl's face. Presently she
answered, in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;291]</span>
"I believe you are."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then why not&mdash;go to him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he doesn't want me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you sure? Is it Jim Lister?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No. He's a good boy, but it's not him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! That's a pity."</p>

<p class="indent">Another pause. Lottie sat very still. She
understood now why the idea of marrying the
Honourable had become suddenly repugnant to
her. The reason was sitting beside her, wondering
what the reason could be. Lottie excelled
in woman's favourite pastime&mdash;playing with
fire&mdash;but this time she had burnt her fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip talked to her a good deal during the next
half-hour. Once he said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I wonder what made you confide in me about
all this. I expect it was because you spotted
that I was a kindred spirit&mdash;in the same state
as yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">"What state?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In love," said Pip simply.</p>

<p class="indent">"In love? Who with?" asked Lottie, ungrammatically
but earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll tell you if you like," said Pip. He
launched into a description of Elsie, reciting his
hopes and fears with all the complete <i>abandon</i> of
the reticent man when once he lets himself go.</p>

<p class="indent">"It isn't often," he concluded, descending to
earth again, "that I reveal my feelings to anybody.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;292]</span>
But I suppose things are rather out of
the common to-day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Does she care for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't see how she possibly can," said Pip,
with absolute sincerity. "But I'm going to ask
her for all that."</p>

<p class="indent">"When?"</p>

<p class="indent">"As soon as I get on my legs again&mdash;financially."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, but when will that be? Debts are awful
millstones, Jack."</p>

<p class="indent">"Debts? What? Oh, I forgot. Well, they are
off."</p>

<p class="indent">"How?"</p>

<p class="indent">"This morning," said Pip, "I got a letter. It
was from old Gresley, the head of the Motor
Works where I am employed. His son used to
be a friend of mine at Cambridge. The old man's
letter is the most astonishing affair. He offers
to take me into partnership! He seems to&mdash;to
have taken a sort of liking for me," he added
apologetically. "Isn't it like a fairy tale?"</p>

<p class="indent">(What old Gresley had said was this: "Partly
because you have always been a good friend to
my son, but chiefly because you combine first-class
mechanical ability with sound common
sense and the power of managing men, I write to
ask if you will enter the firm as a partner, on
equal terms with Harry. He has brains and you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;293]</span>
have ballast. Between you, you should sweep
the board. I am getting old. Once the business
is fairly gripped by you, I shall retire and leave
you to run the show together. Give up your
present post and come here at once, so that we
may discuss matters more fully and settle details.")</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you'll be rich again?" said Lottie wonderingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well enough off, at any rate," said Pip, "to
go and have it out&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"With <i>her</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. Here's your train. I'll get your ticket."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip put the Principal Boy into an empty first-class
carriage, and having shut the door conversed
with her through the open window. The
engine gave an impatient whistle, but the line
was not clear, and the starting-signal remained
obstinately red.</p>

<p class="indent">"Got any money?" said Pip awkwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, thanks. Enough to keep me going."</p>

<p class="indent">The train still delayed, and Pip said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I say, will you take my advice?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Depends on what it is."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go to Jim Lister."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well&mdash;I'll see," said the girl rather brokenly.
She had borne up bravely till now, but the prospect
of parting from her protector and the coming
plunge into the unknown were telling their tale.
Suddenly she looked up.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;294]</span>
"Jack," she whispered, "come with me!"</p>

<p class="indent">The two gazed at each other steadily. Never
was there a more direct invitation, and no man
knows what thoughts passed through Pip's heart,
or how great the battle that was fought and won
during that brief minute. At length he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am still your father's paid servant, and
until I have seen him and thrown up my billet
I must stay here."</p>

<p class="indent">Lottie bowed her head submissively. She knew
her man.</p>

<p class="indent">"But I'll tell you what," continued Pip. "To-morrow
I shall be in town. If you <i>still</i> want
help, send a line to me at the Oxford and Cambridge
Club, and I'll come to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"You promise?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I promise. But <i>you</i> must promise not to
write unless you really need me."</p>

<p class="indent">Lottie, a little mystified, agreed.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the red signal-light turned to green.
The guard at the rear of the train broke off an
engrossing conversation with the only porter,
and waved his lantern. The engine gave a preliminary
quiver.</p>

<p class="indent">Lottie and Pip shook hands. The girl's eyes
were full of tears. Poor Principal Boy! Kindness
which asked for nothing in return had been
a rarity in her life. Suddenly she said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Give us a kiss, Jack!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;295]</span>
Pip complied, with a satisfactory thoroughness
that elicited a humorous expostulation from the
only porter, who was passing by.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-bye!" he said. "You'll be all right
when you get to King's Cross."</p>

<p class="indent">Which cryptic remark was the last he ever
addressed to the Principal Boy, for the train
glided out of the station, and he never saw her
again.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Before leaving the station Pip despatched the
following telegram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Lister, Crown Theatre, Strand, London.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Arriving King's Cross 7.30. Can you meet me?
Want help badly.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lottie.</span>
</p></div>

<p class="indent">The following morning, having discarded his
chauffeur's attire and departed from Broadoak
Manor, after listening to an eloquent and most
enjoyable valedictory address from its tenant,
Pip returned to London. At the end of a highly
satisfactory interview with the Gresleys he
turned his steps in the direction of the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, which he had not entered
for three years.</p>

<p class="indent">He made himself known to those in authority,
and announced that he had now returned from
"abroad." He then asked if there was any
letter for "Armstrong," which, he explained
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;296]</span>
rather lamely, had been sent him under that
name, "by mistake."</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, there was a note left by a messenger that
afternoon. He opened it. It contained a single
line&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="indent">All's well; and we thank you&mdash;<i>both</i> of us!</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lottie Lister.</span></p>

<h3>AN ANCIENT GAME</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> on the east coast of Scotland lie
the famous Links of Eric. The district has not
changed much, to all seeming, during the last
thousand years&mdash;or ten thousand, for that
matter. Then, as now, the links were a sandy
waste, a wilderness of whin, sand, and bent,
the home of countless scuttling rabbits and
plaintive peewits. Later, perhaps, when William
the Conqueror was creating a disturbance in the
southern parts of remote England, a tiny fishing
town began to grow up round the little harbour
reluctantly yielded by the tall red cliffs to the
eternal industry of the ocean, and the adjoining
strip of low-lying sand-dunes acquired the title
that it now bears, derived, it is said, from the
name of the Norse king who once landed on
this, the only piece of accessible shore for miles,
and was there slain, after a bloody battle with the
neighbouring lord and his retainers. The town
itself will have none of these barbaric titles, but
exists smugly and contentedly as Port Allan.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was through her little-valued links
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;300]</span>
that Port Allan achieved fame. Two hundred
years ago a new minister came from St. Andrew's,
and introduced the men of Port Allan to a game
called Golf. They took to it in their deliberate,
methodical fashion, and laid out a little course
on the hitherto neglected Links of Eric. Thither
they repaired on fine summer evenings, carrying
queer long-nosed wooden clubs and feather-stuffed
balls. The golfing minister went the way of all
flesh, and his compeers with him, but the golf
endured. Generations of slow-moving fisher-folk,
ecclesiastical luminaries, and holiday-making
scholars&mdash;for the fame of the links brought
visitors from so great a distance as a hundred
miles&mdash;all played round the links in their day,
recking nothing of Medal Scores, Colonel Bogey,
the Schenectady putter, or other modern excrescences.
They used their long-nosed wooden
clubs to some purpose, and though they did not
drive the feather-stuffed ball very far they drove
it very straight. Once the great Allan Robertson
visited Port Allan. He pronounced favourably
on the course, and a word from Allan Robertson
in those days was as good as a descriptive article
in "Golf Illustrated" in these. And so for many
years the Links of Eric grew steadily in favour
with golfers.</p>

<p class="indent">But one day&mdash;one momentous day&mdash;the men
of England came to the conclusion that golf was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;301]</span>
the one and only game worth playing, and Scotland
the one and only place to play it in. Accordingly,
with that spontaneous readiness to
suit the action to the word that has ever been
the characteristic of an Empire-making race,
they migrated with their wives and families across
the Border, and proceeded to hew divots from
the face of Scotland with an eagerness and
<i>bonhomie</i> which was equalled only by the unanimity
with which they forbore to replace them.
Golf, which had existed for centuries as a sort
of religious ceremony, to be cultivated by its
votaries in reverent silence and at a strictly
processional pace, suddenly became a species of
bank-holiday picnic; and those ancient and
highly respectable burghs which fostered the
game in especial purity were converted into
rather <i>recherch√©</i> editions of Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p class="indent">However unpleasant this foray might be for
the Scottish golfer, it presented certain compensating
features to the Scottish railways and
hotel-proprietors. Of remote villages, which had
formerly figured in the traffic returns as occasional
yielders of a truck-load of fish, there now
appeared highly-tinted pictures, with the Company's
name at the top and a list of trains at the
bottom. The hotel proprietors, on their part,
quickly realising that to the average Englishman
a golf-course consists of any tract of land in Scotland
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;302]</span>
plentifully endowed with rabbit-holes, hastily
staked out a claim on the nearest collection
of sand-hills, and advertised to all and sundry
that visitors to their hotel would be permitted,
for a consideration, to play golf over the celebrated
links of so-and-so, "adjoining the hotel."</p>

<p class="indent">Port Allan was one of the places which benefited
by reason of the boom. The nearest railway
station was seven miles away, but the Company
quickly remedied that defect, and advertised
through bookings from King's Cross. A special
time-table was published, decorated at the top
with a coloured view of the Links of Eric, in the
foreground of which a golf-match was in progress
between a gentleman in a sky-blue Norfolk
suit and a red cap, and a lady in a red dress
and a sky-blue hat. The lady was depicted in the
act of driving off from the tee (with a blue putter);
while the gentleman, rather ungallantly,
had gone forward a few yards, and was engaged
in playing out of the first bunker (with a red
brassie).</p>

<p class="indent">The inhabitants of Port Allan soon realised
that to play golf over their own links in summer
was out of the question. They accordingly accepted
the situation, and, relegating their own
golfing efforts to the autumn, turned to the
equally congenial task of spoiling the Egyptians.
Elderly seafaring men, who had hitherto extracted
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;303]</span>
a precarious livelihood from the grudging
ocean, abandoned their nets and took to carrying
clubs, the fee of eighteenpence per round which
they were permitted to charge being inclusive
of a vast amount of caustic criticism, and priceless,
if unintelligible, advice.</p>

<p class="indent">Behold, then, the Links of Eric one fine morning
in early August. Observe the throng of
golfers, male and female, young and old. Here
you may see Youth, full of slashing drives and
strange oaths, and Age, known for his sage counsel
and long putts. Here is a schoolboy, with bare
knees and head, and a supple swing that makes
middle-aged golfers wriggle with envy. Here is
a "golfing minister." His clubs are old-fashioned
and his ball has been repainted; you will outdrive
him over and over again, but unless you
have at least a stroke in hand when it comes to
approaching and putting, he will beat you. Those
two men over there, playing in their shirt-sleeves,
are Americans, of course. They are playing
very keenly, but they are thinking, not of the
game, but of some entirely new and original way
of winning it. The fat gentleman is an Englishman.
He originally took up golf by his doctor's
orders, but by this time is badly bitten. He
wears a red coat, adorned with the buttons of
the Toadley-in-the-Hole Golf Club, and ekes
out his want of skill by the help of patent clubs,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;304]</span>
an india-rubber tee,&mdash;ye gods!&mdash;and a wealth
of technical phraseology. The couple in the middle
of the course, with a highly profane throng
waiting behind them, are a honeymoon, and as
such ought not to be there at all. Their balls
lie side by side in a rabbit-scrape; and they are
disputing, not as to the right club to use, but
whether Pussy can possibly love Sweetie more
than Sweetie loves Pussy. Ah! an irascible
couple have driven into them! Sweetie, at once
putting a protecting arm round Pussy, turns and
glares at them wrathfully, but Pussy, looking
distinctly relieved, picks up both balls and impels
her newly acquired lord over an adjacent
sand-hill to a secluded spot that she knows of,
where they can sit in peace till lunch-time.</p>

<p class="indent">But besides these anomalies and curiosities&mdash;common
objects of all golf-links in summer&mdash;there
are some real golfers to be seen. Here are
two young men worth watching. Number One is
addressing his ball for an approach shot. It will
have to be a cunning stroke, for there is a yawning
bunker in front of the green and a thick
patch of whin beyond it. If he attempts to run
the ball up, the bunker will catch it, and if he
plays to carry the bunker, the chances are that
he will overrun the green and find himself in the
whins. He plays a fine lofted ball, which drops
on to the hard green six yards from the pin,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;305]</span>
and then, with that marvellous back-spin which
only a master-hand can impart, gives a curious
staggering rebound, and after trickling forward
for a few yards lies almost dead.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good shot!" remarks Number Two, and
turns to play his own ball. It is lying very badly
in some bents, half buried in sand. Number
Two&mdash;he is a left-hander&mdash;rejects the proffered
niblick and selects a ponderous driving-mashie.
Then, with an opening of the shoulders
and an upward lift that betray the cricketer in
every movement, he gives a mighty slog, and
propels a confused cloud of sand, bents, and
ball into the bunker guarding the green sixty
yards away.</p>

<p class="indent">"Too good that time, Pip," remarks his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn't think I could get so far," replied Pip.
"However, I get a stroke from you this hole, so
wait a bit."</p>

<p class="indent">He descended into the bunker, but the ball
was reposing in a heel-mark, and it required
two even of Pip's earth-compelling niblick shots
to remove it. Colquhoun, plus one at St. Andrew's,
consequently took the hole in four.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was staying at the Station Hotel, by himself.
The motive which had brought him to a
distant part of Scotland, to play a game at which
he was far from being first-class, will appear in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;306]</span>
due course. Sufficient to say that it was a strong
motive, and an exceedingly ancient one,&mdash;a
motive which has brought about even more surprising
events than the abandonment of first-class
cricket, on the eve of a Test Match, by
the finest amateur bowler in England.</p>

<p class="indent">They finished their match half an hour later,
Pip, who was in receipt of a half, being one
down. As they turned to leave the last green
Pip found himself confronted by a large man in
a Panama hat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip!" cried the stranger&mdash;"Pip! Bless my
soul! What the blazes are you doing in Scotland
in August?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo, Raven," replied Pip. "Fancy meeting
you, old man!"</p>

<p class="indent">They turned and walked up the road together.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why aren't you playing for the County?"
inquired Pip severely.</p>

<p class="indent">"Missis," replied Raven Innes laconically.
Then he added,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Said we must go away for August on account
of the kiddies. I'm taking a holiday from cricket
in consequence: golf isn't a bad substitute. But
what are you doing here, young man? Aren't
you about due at Old Trafford for the Test
Match?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," replied Pip, beginning to fill his pipe;
"I'm not."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;307]</span>
Innes stopped short in his walk.</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't mean to tell me," he said, "that
they have been such fools&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not that," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! So you're chosen all right, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I'm chosen, but I'm not going to play."</p>

<p class="indent">"Great C√¶sar! Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I'm a bit stale, and I'm rather off
cricket, and&mdash;and I want to play golf."</p>

<p class="indent">Now Raven Innes was a man of the world.
Moreover, he was a married man,&mdash;married to
a young and pretty wife,&mdash;and married men
know things that are not revealed to the ordinary
unobservant bachelor. Constant female
society sharpens their wits. A woman has only
one explanation for all male eccentricities, and
Raven Innes had been married long enough to
know that in nine cases out of ten this explanation
is the correct one. He therefore pursued the
conversation on the lines which he felt sure would
have been adopted by Mrs. Raven had she been
present.</p>

<p class="indent">"We have taken a cottage down the road&mdash;'Knocknaha,'
it's called&mdash;so you must come
and look us up. No time like the present, so come
along now. By the way, my little sister is staying
with us&mdash;Elsie. Have you seen her yet?"</p>

<p class="indent">The diplomat cocked an inquiring eye in the
direction of his victim. Personally he had never
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;308]</span>
noticed anything unusual in Pip's relations with
Elsie, but in matters of this kind Raven was
guided entirely by his wife, and as that female
Hawkshaw, whose feminine instincts were infallible
in these cases, had long since informed
him that there was something in the wind, he
was now embarking upon this elephantine effort
of cross-examination.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, really?" said Pip, who was lighting his
pipe at the moment. "No, I haven't seen her
yet."</p>

<p class="indent">He threw away the match and walked on, his
features as immobile as usual. But his old weakness
betrayed him, and he turned a dusky red.</p>

<p class="indent">Raven Innes noted this portent, chuckled,
and inwardly dug himself in the ribs, as we all
do when we find that our natural acumen has
unearthed a savoury secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly a year had passed since Pip returned
from "abroad," once more to take his place
among his friends and in first-class cricket.
During that time he had met Elsie only once&mdash;at
Pipette's wedding; but he had gathered
then, by dint of some artful cross-examination,
that she would probably be the guest of the
Ravens at Port Allan during August. Had
Raven Innes realised that their chance meeting
on the links that morning had been the result
of a fortnight's planning, waiting, and scheming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;309]</span>
on the part of the enigmatical young man beside
him; that the said young man had abandoned
first-class cricket in the height of the season, and
taken the precaution of arriving at Port Allan a
full week before he knew Elsie was due there,
in order to avoid all appearance of having followed
her, and had even endeavoured to give
a casual appearance to their prospective and
greatly desired meeting by withholding his
presence for another three days,&mdash;Raven Innes
would have realised that a superficial blush may
conceal a greater depth of guile than the ordinary
male intellect can fathom.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">There are many kinds of golfer, and there are
many kinds of girl, but there are only two kinds
of girl with whom it is possible to play golf. One
is the beginner and the other is the expert.</p>

<p class="indent">The beginner is wholly irresponsible. Let us
imagine that she is taken out in a "mixed"
foursome. She refers to her clubs as "sticks,"
or even "poles." She declines the services of
a caddie, with a little scream of apprehension
at the very idea of such publicity. For the
same reason she refuses to drive her ball from
the tee if any one is "looking." Indeed, she has
been known to implore her partner to turn even
his sympathetic back during that performance.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;310]</span>
This excessive shyness is maintained all the way
to the first hole, and, unless carefully watched,
she will arrive at the green, ball in hand, having
been unable to endure the critical gaze of two
men at least a hundred and fifty yards away,
who she feels convinced are laughing at her.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she feels more comfortable. A long
drive by her partner elicits a little shriek of
astonished admiration, which flatters his manly
vanity, and goes far to mitigate the handicap
of her assistance. She at once begins to imitate
his stance and swing, straddles well over the
ball, shuts both eyes, gives a mighty swipe, and
usually falls down, the necessity of "tackety
shoon" being as yet unrevealed to her. On she
goes, perfectly at her ease now, though a little
hot and flustered, babbling incessantly during
the stroke, regardless of the sinister frowns of the
man who is endeavouring to play it. Should she
miss the ball altogether, she is moved to unnecessary
mirth; should she by any chance hit it
out of sight, say over a sand-hill, she scampers
up the slope after it at a run, and announces its
discovery at the top of her voice, upsetting the
nerves of all the old gentlemen within earshot.
On the green her actions are as characteristic as
ever. In running the ball up to the hole she either
hits the ground behind it and sends it six inches,
or plays a shot which necessitates the departure
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;311]</span>
of her long-suffering partner, niblick in hand
and scarlet in the face, to an adjacent bunker.
Short putts she invariably holes out by an ingenious
and unblushing push-stroke, which no
one has the heart to question or the courage to
criticise. So the game proceeds. It is not golf,
but then you never expected it to be. It is another
game, even older, and even better.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few such rounds as this the dread seriousness
of the game descends upon her, and she
loses some of her charm. She never speaks, for
she knows now that there is a rule on the subject.
Her irresponsible gaiety is gone; she is actually
nervous; and after missing an easy stroke
(which she does quite as frequently as before),
she looks piteously at her partner, and even
sighs enviously as the lady on the other side,
whom she has hitherto regarded as a mere example
of how clothes should not be worn, plays
a perfect approach out of a bad lie. In short,
she has reverted to the status of the ordinary
duffer, and as such she ceases to be anything
but a common nuisance&mdash;unless, of course, sir,
you take a special interest in her, in which case
you will find her quite as attractive, and infinitely
less exhausting, over a quiet game of
croquet or spilikins.</p>

<p class="indent">But when&mdash;or rather if&mdash;she attains to the
degree of a real golfer; if she can drive off before
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;312]</span>
a crowd without giggling or blushing, and can
be trusted not to shut her eyes when taking a
full swing,&mdash;then she is indeed a pearl of price,
for she is now a congenial companion, from the
golfing as well as the other point of view. She is
neither childishly frivolous nor grimly determined.
She looks upon golf neither as a glorified
form of croquet nor as woman's one mission in
life. Behold her as she walks across the links to
begin her morning round. She calls up her favourite
caddie with a little nod of her head, and
gives you a cheery good-morning when she
finds you waiting at the first tee. (A pretty girl-golfer
is about as nearly perfect as a woman can
be, but even that cannot make her punctual.)
She is neatly turned out: she has abandoned kid
boots with high heels, and wears trim shoes with
plenty of nails in them. Her head is usually
bare, or perhaps she wears a motor-veil tied
under her chin; at any rate, the unstable edifice
of former days no longer flaps in the breeze
and obscures her vision. She is independent
too. She does not take the first club the caddie
offers: she chooses her own, and rates the boy
for not having cleaned it better. No longer does
she put her ball in her pocket for fear of keeping
back the green; on the contrary, she drives repeatedly
(and I am afraid purposely) into a steady-going
foursome in front. It is useless to remind
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;313]</span>
her of a by-law which says that ladies must invariably
give way to gentlemen and allow them
to pass.</p>

<p class="indent">"Real gentlemen," she remarks, "would invariably
give way to ladies and allow <i>them</i> to
pass." And her iron-shot bumps past the head
of an octogenarian who is trying to hole out a
long putt on the distant green.</p>

<p class="indent">To look at her now you would never guess that
she was once a shrinking <i>d√©butante</i>, a hewer of
turf, and a drawer of water from the eyes of the
green-keeper. Her putting is still erratic, and she
is rather helpless in heavy sand; but, given a
clean lie and a fair stance, she will handle her
light clubs to some purpose, and her swing is a
"sicht for sair een." If you are at all off your
game she will beat you; therefore it is advisable
to offer her points before beginning the match,
not so much because she needs them as to preserve
your masculine self-respect in the event of
a "regrettable incident."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Elsie Innes combined all the virtues of
the girl-golfer in her own graceful young body.
Though she had "filled out" considerably since
we last saw her, she was anything but a hobnailed,
masculine woman. She was neither
heavily built nor muscular; she looked almost
too fragile to play at all. But she handled her
light clubs with a suppleness and dexterity usually
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;314]</span>
given only to a schoolboy of fourteen, and
the length of her drive was amazing. She was
always graceful, always cool, and, as Pip once
noted to himself, "never got either hot or hairy."</p>

<p class="indent">After their first meeting at Raven's cottage
Pip and Elsie saw each other constantly. They
played a round of golf every day, usually between
tea and dinner, the hour when the ardent male
golfer relaxes from his noonday strenuousness
and turns to thoughts of mixed foursomes. Usually
Pip and Elsie played Mr. and Mrs. Raven.
Raven was a far better golfer than Pip, but then
Elsie was very much the superior of Mrs. Raven,
which made matters even. Many were the battles
that raged between the two couples. At first
victory favoured the married pair. Raven, besides
being a scratch golfer, was a good general,
and his unruffled coolness and unerring advice
made the most of his wife's limited powers. Pip
and Elsie, on the other hand, did not "combine"
well. Elsie, who (strictly between ourselves)
fancied her golf not a little, insisted on dictating
the line of action to be followed on each occasion,
and more than once told Pip what club to use.
Pip, though relatively her inferior, declined at
first to be trampled upon by a female, even a
high-spirited goddess with fair hair and a swing
like an archangel. But few men in Pip's condition
argue the point long: after a brief struggle
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;315]</span>
to assert the predominance of man he subsided
completely, and, as he thought, rather diplomatically.
There he was wrong. The sage of antiquity
who composed the uncomplimentary proverb
about "a woman, a dog, and a walnut tree"
knew something of life, and the course of Pip's
true love might have run a good deal smoother if
he had put down his masculine foot a little more
frequently. However, there is no doubt that
after his capitulation their golfing efforts reached
a higher level than before. After a series of
matches extending over a week, each side stood
with three games to its credit, Pip and Elsie just
managing to draw level by winning a match on
the last green on Saturday evening.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunday golf is not encouraged in Scotland.
Consequently next morning Elsie accompanied
her relatives to one of the numerous places of
worship in Port Allan, which ancient township
possessed its full complement of Auld Licht,
Established, United, and Wee Free kirks, and
other homes of religious controversy. Pip stayed
on the hotel veranda and smoked, watching them
pass but lacking nerve to join them. He summoned
up sufficient courage, however, to put in
an appearance at Knocknaha during the afternoon.
He was even more silent than usual,
though he made a hearty tea.</p>

<p class="indent">After that meal he invited Elsie to come for a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;316]</span>
walk with him. She consented, and they set off
together, followed by the amused glances of
Mr. and Mrs. Raven.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a glorious August afternoon. The North
Sea, blue and placid, lapped gently against the
red cliffs, or ran with a slow hiss up the slope of
yellow sand which bordered the Links of Eric.
There was hardly any wind&mdash;just enough, in
fact, to keep the air clear; and Pip and Elsie, as
they lounged luxuriously in a hollow at the top
of a sand-hill,&mdash;their walk had been strictly
limited to a Sabbath day's journey,&mdash;could see
the smoke of a steam-trawler on the horizon
though they could not see the ship herself.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is nice," murmured Elsie luxuriantly,
as she arranged her holland skirt to cover up as
much of her tan boots as possible&mdash;her Sunday
frock had found its way back to her wardrobe
soon after church. "Sunday really does feel like
a day of rest if one plays golf all the week."</p>

<p class="indent">"Talking of golf," said Pip, "you haven't
played me yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"I've played with you all the week," replied
Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"With me, not against me," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I see. All right; I'll play with Raven
to-morrow against you and Ethel. We shall beat
you horribly, though."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie was in a very perverse mood.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;317]</span>
"Yes, but I want a single&mdash;a match," explained
Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Pip lit his pipe, which had
somehow gone out, and continued,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall we say to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Afraid not," said Elsie. "I rather think I
promised to play one of the men in the hotel."</p>

<p class="indent">This was not strictly true, but Elsie was in a
curious frame of mind that evening. There was
no reason why she should not have played Pip his
match, nor was she particularly averse to doing
so. But some flash of feminine intuition, infallible
as ever, was unconsciously keeping her in the defensive
attitude natural to women in such cases.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it Anstruther?" inquired Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said Elsie rashly.</p>

<p class="indent">"In that case your match is off, for he has had
a wire, and must go to-morrow morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not Mr. Anstruther," said Elsie. "I had
forgotten he was going away." (This was strictly
true.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it Gaythorne?" asked Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie regarded him covertly, through conveniently
long lashes. She suspected another trap.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," she said at last.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's queer," remarked Pip meditatively.
"He was saying only last night that he expected
to play you to-morrow morning."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;318]</span>
Elsie, who had fallen into the not uncommon
error of underrating her adversary, was for the
moment quite flabbergasted by this bold stroke.
Then, quickly noting the joint in her opponent's
harness, she interposed swiftly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Why did you ask me to play with <i>you</i>,
then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I didn't think you ought to play with him,"
said Pip coolly. "He's an utter outsider."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall play with whom I like," said Elsie
hotly.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right," said Pip; "I'll tell him. What
time do you want him to be down at the tee?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie, though not inexperienced in the management
of young men, fairly gasped for breath.
This slow-speaking, serious youth would, unless
she could speedily extricate herself, either compel
her to acknowledge herself defeated or else force
her into an unpremeditated golf-match with a
comparative stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">"I&mdash;I tell you I don't want to play with Mr.
Gaythorne," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, sorry!" replied Pip; "I thought you said
you did. Very well, I'll tell him not to come,
and you can play me instead."</p>

<p class="indent">Now, it is obviously unwise to continue to
assert to a second party that you have a previous
engagement with a third party when you have
not, especially when your knowledge is shared
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;319]</span>
by the second party. So Elsie did the only possible
thing, and laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, Pip," she said; "I'll play you. Be
down at the tee early and we'll get off before the
rush begins. As it is, I shall be driven into all the
time, playing with a duffer!"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, quite unmoved, parried this insult with
another.</p>

<p class="indent">"Right-o," he said. "What shall I give you&mdash;a
half?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">"As a favour," she replied, "and to preserve
your masculine pride, I will play you level.
Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip interrupted. He was not looking quite so
serene as usual, and he puffed almost nervously
at his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">"What shall we play for?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In a match," he explained, "it is usual to
play for some small stake&mdash;a ball, or a bottle
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense!" said Elsie decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a bit; it's often done," said Pip. "What
shall we play for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall play for love."</p>

<p class="indent">"Love? Right!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was an awkward pause. Technical
terms lead one into such pitfalls. Elsie felt herself
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;320]</span>
beginning to turn pink. Pip, who might have
smoothed the situation over, made it worse by
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"So it's to be a love-match?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was no mistaking Elsie's colour now.
A blush ran flaming over her face in a great
scarlet wave. But Pip proceeded quite calmly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"That's just what I want it to be. I'm glad
you said that, though of course you didn't mean
it in that way. You are a good golfer. On your
day you can get round in, say, ninety. I am a
rotter. I have only twice got round under a
hundred. If I play you level to-morrow and beat
you, will you&mdash;marry me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Pip!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie was sincere enough now. She was genuinely
astounded. She knew Pip for a man of
blunt speech and direct methods, but she had
hardly been prepared for this. She merely
turned from red to white, and repeated her
astonished cry,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Pip!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Pip continued, quite coolly now,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I mean it. I have been in love with you
from the first moment I saw you, the afternoon
that I took you to the Blanes' garden-party.
You remember?" The girl nodded gravely. "I
was bowled over then, and I've worshipped you
ever since. I suppose you knew that? Women
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;321]</span>
are always said to know these things. Did you
know?"</p>

<p class="indent">This was a long speech for Pip, but it drew no
answer from Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you know?" he repeated gently.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie plucked a few bents from the sand around
her and began to plait them with great care.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you know?" asked Pip for the third time.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie answered, without raising her eyes&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;at least, lately. But you never gave
yourself away, Pip."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know that. I rather prided myself on it. I
should have asked you long ago, only after the
Governor's death I had to&mdash;work for a living.
It's only recently I have become a man with
money. Besides, I think these things ought to
be kept sacred, just between&mdash;between the two,
you know. I haven't a very high opinion of
myself, but I do think I can keep a secret. I
wasn't going to have you talked about, even by
friends. However"&mdash;he brought his gaze back
from the distant horizon with an effort&mdash;"we
are wandering from the point. Will you play me
a match, Elsie,&mdash;a love-match?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie raised her eyes for the first time.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, don't be absurd!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Absurd? Not a bit. I think it's a jolly sensible
notion. I simply can't talk the sort of rot
that men in love are supposed to talk&mdash;it isn't
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;322]</span>
in me. All I can do is to make you a fair offer
like this&mdash;a sort of challenge to single combat,
you know. If I win, you give in to me; if you
win, well, I shall have to chuck it, that's all."</p>

<p class="indent">"But Pip," said Elsie, "supposing I...."</p>

<p class="indent">Then she checked herself suddenly, leaving
Pip to wonder what she had meant to say. He
himself could see no flaw in the scheme. His
own natural modesty prevented him from believing
that Elsie, glorious creature, could ever desire
to take him of her own free will, and consequently
his simple mind had reverted to the
primitive notion, inherent in most men, of marriage
by conquest. His challenge to a golf-match
struck him as an eminently sporting offer.</p>

<p class="indent">"I figured it out this way," he went on after
a pause. "I said to myself, 'She will never
marry me simply for the asking, of course'; so&mdash;what
did you say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing." Elsie had suddenly ceased plaiting
and parted her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"So," continued Pip, "I said, 'The only way
to make her give in will be to get the better of
her in something&mdash;to show superiority over
her in some way. It will be no use my trying
to persuade her by arguments. I'm slow of
speech, especially with women, and Elsie would
simply talk me downstairs and into the street
in about two minutes. A girl like her won't
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;323]</span>
surrender without a struggle. Quite right too.
I shall have to try something else. It mustn't
be too one-sided either way, for if it's in her
favour I shall lose, and if it's in mine she won't
accept. It must be a fair match.'"</p>

<p class="indent">And so he continued, simply, honestly, laying
bare to her all the mighty scheme whereby he
proposed to overcome her stubborn resistance.
He had first thought, he told her, of a single-wicket
cricket-match, but had abandoned the
project as being too greatly in his favour. "You
keep a very straight bat for a girl," he said, "but
you can never resist my slow curly one, that
looks as if it were going to pitch outside the off
stump, and doesn't. I know your weaknesses,
you see," he added with a friendly smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Pip," said Elsie, in a rather subdued
tone, "some of them."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip then proceeded to enumerate the other
tests of skill that had occurred to him. "I
thought of croquet," he said, "but really croquet
is such d&mdash;Well, anyhow, I don't think croquet
would have done. Billiards is too fluky. Chess
is piffle. There are lots of other games, but you
are so&mdash;so weak!" (Elsie's slight frame stiffened
indignantly at this.) "Then I thought of
the golf-match, and I saw at once that that was
the ticket. So I packed up my bag and wired
for rooms at the hotel here, and have been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;324]</span>
waiting for you to arrive ever since the first of
August."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause&mdash;a long pause. Elsie was
thinking&mdash;of what, she hardly knew. Pip was
watching her, anxious to see how she received
his great idea. Presently he continued,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course the golf-match is all in your favour.
The chances are about three to one on your
winning."</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Elsie flared up with a curious little
spirit of anger. Her mind, highly trained though
it was in these matters, could not quite appreciate
Pip's Quixotic consideration for an opponent.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip," she said, "I don't believe you <i>want</i>
to win! The whole thing is simply a joke on your
part&mdash;your idea of a joke. I don't think it's a
very nice one: you know you can't beat me. If
you really want to marry me you wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall beat you all right," said Pip simply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know I shall, that's all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I <i>know</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">A new idea occurred to Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"You dare to insinuate," she said, "that I
would&mdash;would purposely let you&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Should I want to marry a girl of that sort?"
asked Pip gravely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;325]</span>
Elsie softened again at this genuine compliment,
but she still felt rather doubtful as to
whether this extraordinary young man really
and truly believed that she was to be won, and
won only, by being beaten in a golf-match. In
any case the situation was becoming difficult.
She began to dust the sand from her skirt and
to make other preparations for departure. Pip
regarded her with some concern.</p>

<p class="indent">"You're not going yet, are you?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. It's getting late."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, will you play me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"On those terms?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course not, Pip. You're not serious."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip leaned forward, and put his hand on her
arm. She had half risen, but she now found herself
sitting down again, rather astonished and
rebellious, listening to what he was saying.</p>

<p class="indent">"Elsie, what is the date to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know," petulantly. "Girls never
know dates."</p>

<p class="indent">"I forgot that. Well, it is the fourteenth of
August. Do you know what is going to happen
at Old Trafford to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why&mdash;the Australians! Fancy forgetting
a Test Match! That comes of playing golf all
day. But, Pip,"&mdash;she stared at him in dismayed
surprise,&mdash;"why aren't you there? Surely you
were chosen?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;326]</span>
"Yes, I was chosen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, why aren't you there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Because I'm here."</p>

<p class="indent">"But, Pip, you ought to be playing cricket."</p>

<p class="indent">"I prefer to play golf."</p>

<p class="indent">"But it's a Test Match."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm going to play in a Test Match of my
own&mdash;here."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie was silent again, and gazed at him, open-eyed.
Pip saw that he had struck the right note.</p>

<p class="indent">"I gave up the cricket-match to play with
you," he said. "Will you play with me?"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie was defenceless against this appeal. She
knew, better than most girls, perhaps, what it
must cost a man to decline an invitation to play
for England.</p>

<p class="indent">"All right, Pip," she said gently, getting up
and shaking her skirt, "I'll play you. Nine
o'clock to-morrow morning. I shall beat you,
though," she added.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip said nothing. It is always politic to
make a virtue of necessity. That is why one allows
a woman the last word.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">They were very silent as they walked home in
the twilight. Pip, having achieved the object
with which he had set out, had no further remarks
to make. Elsie seemed less at ease, and
kept shooting half-amused, half-angry glances
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;327]</span>
at the obtuse young man beside her. She objected
to being treated as something between a
Prehistoric Peep and a Scratch Medal.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they came to Raven Innes's cottage.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you coming in, Pip?" inquired Elsie as
she stood at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, thanks. Raven would keep me up all
hours, and I'm going to bed <i>very</i> early. Good-night."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip&mdash;" began Elsie rather unsteadily.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip turned quickly, and beheld her standing
on the step, framed by the open doorway. The
setting sun glinted on her hair, and there was
a curious and unfamiliar note in her voice as she
addressed him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip," she said, "I don't like the idea of this
match. It's&mdash;it's contrary to Nature, somehow.
Golf wasn't intended to settle such questions."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip made no reply, but gazed upon her. In
matters of this kind he was not very "quick in
the uptake," as they say in Scotland. Elsie made
a curious little grimace to herself, and continued&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, supposing you wanted, <i>very</i> much, to
get something that lay across a stream which
looked rather deep, would you make a jump and
risk a ducking, or would you walk miles on the
off-chance of finding a bridge?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;328]</span>
They looked at each other steadily for a minute,
while Pip worked out the answer to this
conundrum.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should probably jump," he replied,&mdash;"that
is, if&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">And then at last light seemed to break upon
him. The blood surged to his brain, and he
stepped forward impetuously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Elsie!" he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">But the door was shut.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"Serve him right, too!" you say. Well, perhaps;
but lack of presumption is a rare and not
unmanly virtue.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<h3>"<i>NATURAM FURCA EXPELLAS ...</i>"</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Alas</span>!</p>

<p class="indent">When Pip slipped out of bed at six o'clock
next morning the window-panes were blurred
and wet, and the Links of Eric were shrouded in
driving sheets of rain.</p>

<p class="indent">His pithy and apposite comments on the situation
were, had he only known it, being reproduced
(in an expurgated form) by a damsel in
a kimono at a bedroom window not far down
the road. Elsie surveyed the rain-washed links
reflectively, and sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a pity!" she said to herself. "I would
have given him such a lesson! Now I suppose
we shall both waste a day."</p>

<p class="indent">With which enigmatical conclusion she crept
into bed again.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip arrived at Knocknaha after breakfast, but
Elsie flatly refused to stir outside until the rain
had ceased. This was no more than her swain
had expected, and he returned resignedly to the
hotel, where he passed an exceedingly unprofitable
morning smoking and playing billiards.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon an ancient mariner in a blue
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;330]</span>
jersey and a high-crowned bowler hat approached
him on the hotel veranda and intimated that the
day was a good one for deep-sea fishing. It was
certainly no day for courting, and Pip, weary in
spirit, was fain to accept the implied invitation.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked to the beach together, and began
to haul down the old man's boat. This done,
the oars and tackle were put in, and the expedition
was on the point of departure when Pip
suddenly realised that it had stopped raining.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hallo!" he said. "Rain over?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Aye," remarked the old man; "it will be a
grand afternoon yet."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip turned upon him suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you sure?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aye."</p>

<p class="indent">"Certain?"</p>

<p class="indent">"'Deed aye," replied the old gentleman rather
testily. "When the top of yon ben is uncovered
like so, and the wind&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"In that case," remarked his employer suddenly,
"I can't come fishing, I'm afraid. I must
go and&mdash;do something else. Another day, perhaps."</p>

<p class="indent">And handing the scandalised mariner half-a-crown,
he departed over the sand-hills at a rate
which would certainly have brought about his
disqualification in any decently conducted walking-race.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;331]</span>
An hour later two players approached the first
tee. They were Elsie and Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the nerves of both these young people,
although neither of them would have admitted
it, were tightly strung up by reason of the present
situation. Each side (as they say in the
election reports) was confident of success, but
their reasons for confidence were widely dissimilar.
Pip meant to win, because in his opinion
the only way to gain a woman's affection is to
show yourself her master at something. If he
had moved in another class of society he would
have subdued his beloved with a poker or a boot,
and she on the whole would have respected him
for it: being a sportsman, he preferred to use a
golf-club.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie meant to win for a different reason. To
begin with, her spirit rebelled against the idea
of becoming the captive of Pip's bow and spear.
She might or she might not intend to marry
him,&mdash;that was her own secret,&mdash;but she had
not the slightest intention of marrying him because
he beat her at golf. Obviously, the first
thing to do was to beat <i>him</i>; then the situation
would be in her hands and she could dictate her
own terms. What those terms were to be she
had not quite settled. All she knew was that
Pip, if he were to have her at all, should have
her as a favour and not as a right.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;332]</span>
Consequently the lust of battle was upon them
both; and it was with undisguised chagrin that
they found three couples awaiting their turn at
the first tee. To be kept back through the green
is irritating enough under any circumstances, but
when you are engaged in a life-and-death struggle
for the matrimonial stakes, absolute freedom of
action is essential.</p>

<p class="indent">Instinctively Pip and Elsie turned and looked
at each other in dismay. Then Pip said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Let's tramp out to the turn, and we'll play
the last nine holes first. It will come to the same
thing in the end."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie agreed, and they set off together across
the links in the direction of the ninth hole. They
had no caddies, for each felt that on this occasion
witnesses were impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, indeed, offered to carry Elsie's clubs as
well as his own, but he was met with a very curt
refusal.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense! You would always be hammering
your own ball a hundred yards away in a bunker,
while I was waiting for my mashie."</p>

<p class="indent">The rain had ceased, and a watery sun shone
down upon them. There was no wind, and the
conditions for golf were almost perfect. The
greens had become a trifle fiery during the recent
drought, and the morning's rain had stiffened
them finely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;333]</span>
Presently they found themselves on the tenth
tee.</p>

<p class="indent">"You drive first," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie began to tee her ball.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's the last time you'll have the chance," he
continued.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie picked up her ball.</p>

<p class="indent">"For that," she remarked, "you shall drive
first. I am not going to take any favours from
a duffer."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip rose from the tee-box on which he was sitting
and took her ball from her hand. Then he
stooped down and teed it carefully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ladies first," he remarked briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie, feeling curiously weak, said no more, but
obeyed him. She made a pretty drive, the ball
keeping low, but towering suddenly before it
dropped. It lay, clean and white, in a good lie a
hundred and fifty yards away.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good beat!" said Pip appreciatively, and
began to address his own ball. His rigid stance
and curious lifting swing were the exact opposite
of Elsie's supple movements, but for all that he
outdrove her by nearly a hundred yards. It was
a Cyclopean effort, and the Haskell ball, as it
bounded over the hard ground, which had been
little affected by the rain, looked as if it would
never stop.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lovely drive!" cried Elsie involuntarily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;334]</span>
"Yes, it was a hefty swipe," admitted Pip.
"I get about two of those each round. The rest
average five yards."</p>

<p class="indent">The hole was a simple one. A good drive usually
left the ball in a nice lie, whence the green,
which was guarded by a bunker, could be reached
with an iron. Pip's ball was lying well up, and
only a chip with his mashie was required to lay
him dead. Elsie found herself faced by that
difficulty which confronts all females who essay
masculine golf-courses. Her ball, though well and
truly struck, was farther from the hole than her
iron could carry it. A brassie-shot would get her
over the bunker, but would probably overrun
the green, which lay immediately beyond; while
anything in the shape of a run-up ball would be
trapped. She decided to risk an iron shot. She
did her best, but the distance was too great for
her. The ball dropped into the bunker with a
soft thud; she required two more to get out; and
Pip, who had succeeded in clearing the bunker
with his second and running down a long putt,
won the hole in an unnecessarily perfect three.</p>

<p class="indent">"One down," said Elsie. "Too good a start,
Pip. You'll lose now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well begun is half done," retorted Pip sententiously,
but he knew in his heart that she
spoke with some truth.</p>

<p class="indent">The next hole was over four hundred yards
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;335]</span>
long, and as such should have been a moral certainty
for Pip. However, his tee-shot travelled
exactly two feet, and his second, played perforce
with an iron, not much farther. Elsie reached
the green in three strokes and a pitch, and won
the hole in six.</p>

<p class="indent">At the next hole Pip sliced his drive, the ball
flying an immense distance and curling away out
of sight to their left. (You must remember that
he was a left-handed player.) Elsie, as usual,
drove a picture of a ball, but just failed to reach
the green with her second. Meanwhile Pip,
tramping at large amid the whin-bushes, found
his ball in a fairly good lie, and with a perfectly
preposterous cleek-shot, which seemed to Elsie to
travel about a quarter of a mile, lay on the edge
of the green. He holed out in two putts, and won
the hole in four to her five.</p>

<p class="indent">They were warming to their work, and each
was playing a characteristic game. The next
two holes were short ones, across a high ridge of
sand and back again. In each case the green
could be reached from the tee. Pip, who had
the honour, buried his ball in the face of the
sand-hill, and as Elsie cleared the summit and
lay on the green, he gave up the hole. Driving
back again, Elsie carried the hill. Pip took his
cleek this time, and his ball followed hers straight
over the guide-post. When they reached the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;336]</span>
green they found the balls lying side by side
ten yards or so from the pin. Pip putted first,
and lay dead, six inches from the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is the first half we'll have had," he said,
as he stood over the hole waiting for Elsie to
putt.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wait a little," said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">She took the line of her putt with great care,
and allowing nicely for the undulations of the
green, just found the hole, and again took the
lead, having won the hole in two to Pip's three.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't talk to me any more about flukes,"
remarked Pip severely as he replaced the flag.</p>

<p class="indent">"I won't," retorted Elsie, "if you won't talk
to me about halves."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip made no mistake at the next two holes,
the sixth and seventh. Both were long and
straight, and, though Elsie drove as sturdily
as ever, Pip's determined slogging brought him
to the green before her each time, and at the
seventh hole he stood one up.</p>

<p class="indent">The next hole was uneventful. The course
here ran straight along the edge of the shore,
with the sea on their right. Pip, unmindful of
the necessity for straightness, hit out with his
usual blind ferocity, and was rewarded by seeing
his comparatively new Haskell fly off in a determined
and ambitious effort to reach the coast of
Norway.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;337]</span>
"The sea," remarked Elsie calmly, "is out of
bounds. You drop another and lose distance."</p>

<p class="indent">With the advantage derived from Pip's mishap,
Elsie just won the hole. The next, the ninth
(the eighteenth and last if they had started from
the first tee), a dull and goose-greeny affair, as
most home-holes are, was halved, and the match
stood "all square at the turn."</p>

<p class="indent">They sat down for a moment on a club-house
seat on their way to the first tee proper, to begin
the second half of their round.</p>

<p class="indent">"By gum, this is a game!" said Pip, smacking
his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rather!" said Elsie as heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">And, at that, a little chill of silence fell upon
them. In the sheer joy of battle they had almost
forgotten the great issues that hung on the result.
They were absolutely alone on the links. The few
players who had ventured out after the rain
ceased were well on their way round&mdash;somewhere
near the ninth hole, probably; and the
green-keeper had taken advantage of slackness in
business to go home to his tea. The sky was
overcast, and promised more rain.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Elsie sprang up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come on," she said briskly. "My honour, I
think?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," replied Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">For the tenth time that afternoon Elsie drove
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;338]</span>
the ball far and sure, straight for the green. Pip's
heart smote him. Who was he that his crass and
brutal masculine muscle should be permitted to
annul the effects of Elsie's delicate precision and
indomitable pluck?</p>

<p class="indent">"Elsie," he said suddenly, "if you don't win
this match&mdash;you deserve to!"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie looked up at him. For a moment her
heart softened. She felt inclined to tell him
something&mdash;that she did not want to win after
all, that the game was his for the asking, that
she would surrender unconditionally. But, even
as she wavered, Pip unconsciously settled the
matter by driving his ball just about twice the
distance of hers. Without another word she
picked up her clubs and set off to play her second.
But her brassie-shot found a bunker, and as her
skill lay in avoiding difficulties rather than in
getting out of them, she soon found it necessary
to give up the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">The stars in their courses now began to fight
for Pip. His ball from the next tee, badly
topped, ran merrily into a bunker, hopped out,
and lay on fair turf five yards beyond. Upset,
perhaps, by this fluke, Elsie for the first time
bungled her tee-shot, sliced her second into a
bad lie, and arrived at the green to find that
Pip, who had been playing a kind of glorified
croquet-match against an invisible opponent,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;339]</span>
with his iron for a mallet and whin-bushes for
hoops, was still a stroke to the good. She lost the
hole.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip was now two up, with seven to play. But
Elsie's cup was not yet full. Her next drive was
caught most unfairly in an aggressively fresh
rabbit-scrape, which lay right in the fairway to
the hole. Pip offered to allow her to lift it, but
she declined. Pip's good luck also continued, for
though he pulled his drive over some sand-hills
to the right, he found his ball lying teed up "on
the only blade of grass for miles," as he explained
on reappearing. He reached the green in two,
Elsie taking three, and won the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">Three down, and six to play!</p>

<p class="indent">There was no question of giving in in Elsie's
heart now. She had hesitated, and was lost, or
at any rate committed to a life-and-death struggle.
There can be no graceful concessions when
one is three down. Under such circumstances a
virtue is apt to be misconstrued into a necessity.</p>

<p class="indent">The next hole was the longest in the course,
and Elsie felt that it was a gift for Pip. That
erratic warrior, however, failed to carry the burn,
distant about fifteen yards from the tee, and was
ignominiously compelled to fish his ball out, drop,
and lose a stroke. This gave Elsie some much-needed
encouragement. Her tee-shot took her
well on her way, and the ball lay so clean for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;340]</span>
her second that she was enabled to take her
driver to it. One more slashing stroke, with her
brassie this time, delivered with all the vigour
and elasticity of which her lithe young body was
capable, and she lay only ten yards from the
green. Pip, despite some absolutely heroic work
with his beloved cleek, was unable to overcome
the handicap of the burn, and reached the green
a stroke behind her. However, his luck stood by
him once more, for he accomplished a five-yard
putt, and halved the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good putt!" said Elsie bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">"All putts of over three feet," remarked Pip,
sententiously quoting one of his favourite golfing
maxims, "are flukes."</p>

<p class="indent">Fluke or no fluke, Elsie was three down, with
only five to play. Another hole lost, and Pip
would be "dormy." Fortunately the next three
holes were of the short and tricky variety, presenting
difficulties more easily to be overcome
by a real golfer than a human battering-ram.
Elsie rose to the occasion. She set her small white
teeth, squared her slim shoulders, and applied
herself to the task of reducing Pip's lead. And
she succeeded. The first hole she took in a perfect
three, Pip, who had encountered a whin-bush
<i>en route</i>, requiring thirteen!</p>

<p class="indent">"One thing," he remarked philosophically as
he mopped his brow, "I did the job thoroughly.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;341]</span>
That whin-bush will never bother anybody
again."</p>

<p class="indent">The next hole was a real triumph for Elsie.
She was weak with her approach, and arrived
on the green in three to Pip's two. Pip played
the like, hit the back of the hole hard, hopped
over, and lay a foot beyond&mdash;dead.</p>

<p class="indent">"This for a half," said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"This" was an exceedingly tricky putt of
about eight yards over an undulating green. She
carefully examined the lie of the ground in both
directions, thrust her tongue out of one corner
of her mouth&mdash;an unladylike habit which intruded
itself at moments of extreme tension&mdash;and
played. The ball left her putter sweetly, successfully
negotiated the various hills and dales of
the green, and dropped into the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">"Grand putt!" said Pip. "I mustn't miss this
of mine."</p>

<p class="indent">He humped his shoulders, bent his knees, and
addressed the ball with all the intense elaboration
usual in a player suddenly called upon to
hole a ball which, under ordinary circumstances,
he would knock in with the back of his putter.
Whether his impossible posture or his recent
unequal encounter with the whin-bush was responsible
will never be known, but the fact
remains that he missed the hole by inches, and
so lost it by one stroke.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;342]</span>
Elsie stifled the scream of delight that rose to
her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"One down, and three to play," she remarked,
in a voice that <i>would</i> tremble a little.</p>

<p class="indent">She made no mistake with the next hole. For
her it was a full drive over a high bunker on to
the green. Pip took his cleek, failed to carry the
bunker, and after one or two abortive attempts
to get out of the shifty sand with his niblick, gave
up the hole, Elsie's drive having laid her a few
yards from the pin.</p>

<p class="indent">"All square," announced Elsie. "Two to
play."</p>

<p class="indent">"My word, Elsie, this is a match!" repeated
Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie replied by an ecstatic sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">Both had entirely forgotten the stake for
which they were playing. For the moment they
were golfers pure and simple. They were no
longer human beings, much less male and female,
less still lover and lass. The whole soul of each
was set on defeating the other.</p>

<p class="indent">But there are deeper passions than golf.</p>

<p class="indent">
"<i>Naturam furca expellas, tamen usque recurret!</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="indent">&mdash;which, being interpreted, means roughly that
if a man and a maid set out to dislodge Human
Nature from their systems with, say, a niblick,
Human Nature will inevitably come home to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;343]</span>
roost. All of which is cold truth, as the event
proved.</p>

<p class="indent">Both gave an exceedingly moderate exhibition
at the seventeenth tee, Pip because he not infrequently
did so, and Elsie because her nerve
was going. Their second shots were better,
though Pip as usual got farther with his cleek
than Elsie with her brassie. Elsie therefore had
to play the odd in approaching the green. This
time she did herself justice. It was a perfect shot.
The ball rose quickly, fell plump upon the green,
checked itself with a little back-spin, and staggered
uncertainly towards the hole. Finally it
stopped, eighteen inches beyond the pin.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie heaved a sigh of the most profound relief.
In all human probability she was sure of a "half"
now, and unless Pip laid his approach dead she
would win the hole outright, and so make the
match safe, safe, safe! She involuntarily clasped
her hands together over her beating heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, impassive as ever, said nothing, but took
his mashie and succeeded in reaching the green.
Since his ball lay a good ten yards short, his
chances of a half looked meagre, but he grasped
his putter with determination and "went for"
the hole. The ball rolled smoothly over the
green, but suddenly turned off a little and just
rolled past the lip of the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bad luck!" said Elsie, with ready sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;344]</span>
Bad luck indeed, but not for Pip. The ball, as
she spoke, suddenly slowed down and stopped
dead, midway, to a hair's-breadth, between the
ball and the hole. Elsie required only a short
putt to win the hole and make herself "dormy,"
and Pip had laid her a dead stymie.</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily they looked at each other. Then
Pip said quickly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll pick up my ball while you putt. We
aren't having any stymies in this match, of
course."</p>

<p class="indent">All the sportswoman in Elsie revolted at this.
"No, Pip," she said; "certainly not. We arranged
nothing about stymies before we started,
so stymies must stand. I must just play it."</p>

<p class="indent">She took her mashie, and made a gallant but
unsuccessful effort to jump her ball over Pip's.
Each holed the next putt, and the match remained
square&mdash;with one to play. Ye gods!</p>

<p class="indent">They were very silent as they prepared to drive
off for the last time. Absolutely alone, far out on
the course, they were now approaching what was
properly "the turn," more than a mile from the
clubhouse.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall put down a new ball here," said Pip,
"just for luck."</p>

<p class="indent">"So shall I," said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"We mustn't mix them on the green, then.
What is yours?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;345]</span>
"A 'Haskell.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Right. Mine's a 'Springvale Kite.'"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie had the honour, and drove as good a ball
as any that afternoon. Pip, determined to take
as few risks as possible, used his cleek, and lay
just beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">The ninth hole on the Links of Eric is known
as "The Crater." The green lies in a curious
hollow on the top of a conical hill. An average
drive leaves your ball at the hill-foot in a good
lie. After this only one stroke is of the slightest
use. You take your farthest-laid-back mashie,
commend your soul to Providence, and smite.
The ball, if struck as desired, will rise up, tower,
and drop into the basin at the top of the hill.
Should you play too strongly you will fly over the
oasis of green turf and fall into a howling wilderness
of bents, sand, and whins on the far side;
should you play short, your ball will bury itself
in the slopes of shifting sand that guard the
approach, and your doom is sealed. It is credibly
reported that all four players in a four-ball match&mdash;scratch
men, every one&mdash;once arrived upon
the Crater green, ball in hand, each having given
up the struggle under the despairing impression
that no opponent could possibly have played
more strokes than himself.</p>

<p class="indent">On paper, this was just the sort of hole that
Elsie should have won from Pip. But in practice
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;346]</span>
the conditions were even. Pip's Herculean wrists
made it possible for him to force the ball up to
the necessary height with a half-mashie-shot, but
for Elsie the task involved a full swing&mdash;and to
keep your ball under absolute control in such circumstances
is about the most difficult shot in
golf. Pip's approaching was at its worst unspeakable,
but on this occasion he was at his best. The
ball sailed grandly into the air and dropped in a
reassuringly perpendicular fashion into the Crater.
Elsie's effort was almost as good, though her
ball curled slightly to the left before dropping.</p>

<p class="indent">They tramped up the long flight of wooden
steps which facilitated the ascent to the summit
with bated breath. A glance at the green would
decide the match.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie reached the top first. Pip heard her give
a little gasp.</p>

<p class="indent">One ball, new, white, and glistening, lay on the
green ten or twelve yards from the hole. The
other was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Whose ball, I wonder?" said Pip calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">They stooped together and examined the ball
as it lay on the green. So close were they that
Pip was conscious of a flutter that passed through
Elsie's body.</p>

<p class="indent">The ball was a "Springvale Kite."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip maintained an absolutely unmoved countenance.
The ball was his, and so, unless a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;347]</span>
miracle intervened, was the hole. And the
match. And&mdash;Elsie!</p>

<p class="indent">But that mysterious quality which, for want
of a better name, we call "sportsmanship," under
whose benign influence we learn to win with
equanimity and lose with cheerfulness, prevented
him from so much as turning an eye
upon his beaten opponent. He merely remarked
briskly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"We must find your pill, Elsie. It can't be far
off."</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie made no reply, but took her niblick and
began to search rather perfunctorily for the lost
ball. She could not speak: the strain of the
match had told upon her. After all she was a
woman, and a girl at that. Pip's iron immobility
made her feel worse. She was beginning to realise
that he was stronger than she was&mdash;a state of
affairs which had never appeared possible to her
before. She wanted to cry. She wanted to
scream. She wanted to go home. She wanted to
beat Pip, and now that feat appeared to be impossible.
Half an hour ago she could have abandoned
the match with good grace. She might
have surrendered with all the honours of war.
Now she would be dragged home at the wheels
of Pip's chariot.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile her opponent, that tender-hearted
and unconscious ogre, was diligently poking
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;348]</span>
about among the bents and whins for the missing
Haskell. He was genuinely distressed that the
match should end thus. Elsie had had cruel luck.
She should have won the last hole, and at any
rate halved this one. He took no pleasure in his
prospective victory. He had wild thoughts of
offering to play the hole again, but dismissed
them at once. Elsie might be only a girl, but she
had the right instincts, and would very properly
regard such an offer as an insult. If only her ball
could be found, though, Pip flattered himself
that he could go on missing putts after Elsie had
reached the green until she had pulled the match
out of the fire. Happy thought! he would so manipulate
the game as to halve the hole and the
match. Then Box <i>and</i> Cox would be satisfied.
Beat Elsie, plucky little Elsie? Perish the
thought! Pip's sentimental heart overflowed.
What a game she had played!</p>

<p class="indent">But, sentiment or no sentiment, a lost ball is a
lost hole, and unless the ball could be found Pip
would be a victor <i>malgr√© lui</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Coming round the face of the hill, Pip suddenly
found himself a few yards from Elsie. She stood
with her back to him, unaware of his presence.
What was she doing? Certainly not looking for
her ball. Was she&mdash;could she&mdash;really&mdash;was
Elsie, the proud, the scornful, the unbending,
actually cr&mdash;? Certainly that flimsy article in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;349]</span>
her hand looked like a handkerchief. Perhaps it
was only a fly in her eye, or something.</p>

<p class="indent">No. Pip watched Elsie for a moment longer.
It was <i>not</i> a fly in her eye. His heart, already
liquescent, melted entirely. He tiptoed away
back to the green.</p>

<p class="indent">Once there, he took three balls from his pocket
and examined them. One was an old and battered
"guttie," the others were "Kites," with
Pip's trade-mark indelibly stamped upon their
long-suffering skins. None of these were suitable
for his fell purpose. Nothing daunted, the conspirator
stole across to Elsie's bag, which lay on
the edge of the green, and selected from the
pocket a new Haskell. Carefully fastening up
the pocket again, he walked to the middle of the
green, and after a furtive glance all round him&mdash;dropped
the ball into the hole.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he uplifted his voice in a full-throated
yell, and hurried towards the spot where he had
last seen Elsie. As he emerged from the hollow
green he met her face to face, coming slowly up
to the ridge. Her cheeks were rather flushed and
her eyes shone, but her handkerchief was resolutely
tucked away in her blouse, and she greeted
Pip with a ready smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Elsie," said Pip excitedly, "I've found your
ball."</p>

<p class="indent">"My ball? Nonsense! Why, I've&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;350]</span>
She checked herself suddenly and followed Pip.
That well-meaning but misguided philanthropist,
heedless of the danger-signals in Elsie's eyes,
walked to the hole, and there, rather with the
air of an amateur conjurer who is not quite certain
whether his audience know "how it's done"
or not, picked out the ball.</p>

<p class="indent">"There's your ball," he said. "Good hole, in
two! Congratters!"</p>

<p class="indent">He handed her the ball with a clumsy gesture
of good-will.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie regarded the unoffending Haskell in a
dazed manner for a moment, turned white and
then red, and finally looked Pip squarely in the
face without speaking. Then she flung the ball
down upon the green, turned on her heel with
a passionate whirl of her skirt, and stalked off,
leaving Pip staring dejectedly after her.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_12" id="CHAPTER_12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>"<i>... TAMEN USQUE RECURRET</i>"</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Elsie</span> walked on. Her face was set, and her
blue-grey eyes had a steely look. In her hand
she carried a golf-ball&mdash;not the one which poor
Pip had "discovered" in the hole, but another,
her own, the genuine article. She had spied it,
lying in an absolutely unplayable position under
a stone, almost immediately after Pip had left
her to her handkerchief. She had picked it up,
and was on her way back to the green to inform
her opponent that the match was his, when she
was startled by a mighty shout, and arrived in
time to witness the whole of Pip's elaborate conjuring-trick.
She grasped the situation at once,
and all the woman in her blazed up at this monstrous
piece of impertinence. Her anger caused
her to overlook the fact that Pip, in his desire
to save her from mortification, had deliberately
sacrificed his chances and thrown away the spoils
of victory. For the moment, all she realised was
that he had "patronised" her, treated her like a
spoiled child, and allowed her to win. Her blood
boiled at the idea. She walked on quickly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;352]</span>
It was not until she had proceeded for a
couple of hundred yards that she discovered that
she was going in the wrong direction. The ninth
hole was situated at the extreme end of the links,
and as she had turned on her heel and swung off
more with the idea of abandoning her present
locality than of reaching another, she realised
that, if she continued on her present course,
every step would take her farther from the hotel.
The discovery added to her wrath. She was
making herself ridiculous now. Pip had probably
noticed her mistake, and was in all likelihood
still standing on the green laughing at her. Return
and walk past him she would not. Only one
thing remained to be done: she would turn in
among the neighbouring sand-hills, make a
d√©tour, and walk home along the shore.</p>

<p class="indent">A friendly gap between two hillocks presented
itself on her left, and she swung round and made
for it. As she passed through the entrance she
could not help looking back. Pip was sitting on
the tee-box beside the now distant green. His
chin was buried in his hands, and he was gazing
out to sea, with his pipe projecting from his
mouth at a reflective angle.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie knew that attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">"He's thinking the situation over," she said
to herself. "Let him: it will do him good. Oh,
dear! where have I got to now?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;353]</span>
She walked into a tiny amphitheatre. All
round her rose walls of fine, shifting, running
sand. They sloped up gradually, to where they
had fallen away from the surrounding summit,
leaving a crumbling precipice six or seven feet
high, crowned with a projecting rim of treacherous
turf,&mdash;a natural bunker if ever there was
one, and almost as difficult of exit for a girl as
for a golf-ball.</p>

<p class="indent">But Elsie made the attempt. She was determined
not to go back through the gap into Pip's
range of vision if she could help it. She struggled
up the slope of yielding sand, which sank
beneath her feet and trickled into her shoes: she
reached the top, laid hold of the overhanging
turf, and tried to pull herself up. But, just as she
placed a triumphant knee on the summit, the
crumbling fabric subsided beneath her weight,
and she was projected in a highly indecorous
fashion to the foot of the slope.</p>

<p class="indent">On this occasion Elsie had some cause to feel
grateful that Pip (or indeed any other gentleman)
was not present. But the idea did not occur to
her. In fact, things had come to a crisis. She
was tired out after her hard game, disappointed
at the result,&mdash;as a matter of fact, she was not
very clear as to whether she had won or lost,&mdash;and
thoroughly demoralised and unstrung by the
strain of recent events. She had planned out the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;354]</span>
present comedy with some care, assigning to
herself the superior and congenial r√¥le of magnanimous
conqueror, and to Pip that of humbled
and grateful victim. Somehow everything had
gone wrong. She was angry with herself and
furious with Pip, and now she had fallen down
several yards of slippery sand and twisted her
foot. She was not sure if the comedy had turned
out a tragedy or a farce; all she realised was
that it had been a dismal failure. In short, Elsie
had expelled Nature with a pitchfork, and now
Nature was coming home to roost.</p>

<p class="indent">But, in spite of the pitchfork, Nature bore no
malice. On the contrary, quite aghast at the
havoc that her brief absence had created, she
at once took her luckless daughter in hand. Consequently
Elsie, poor, distracted, overwrought
Elsie, threw herself down on the scanty grass,
and found immediate relief in woman's priceless
and ever-to-be-envied panacea for all ills&mdash;a
good cry.</p>

<p class="indent">How long she lay sobbing she did not know.
When she at length raised her head from the turf
and began to dab her eyes with a damp and entirely
inadequate pocket-handkerchief, she became
aware, with a curious lack of surprise, that
Pip was sitting a few yards from her. His pipe
was no longer in his mouth, and he was regarding
her intently with serious eyes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;355]</span>
"You left your clubs behind you," he said.
"I brought them along."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you," said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Finally Elsie completed
operations with the handkerchief, and looked
Pip squarely in the face. Her tears seemed in
some mysterious way to have washed all feelings
of anger, restraint, and false sentiment out of her
head. For all that, she was not absolutely comfortable.
Pip must, of course, be punished for
having put that ball into the hole; but the performance
of this duty demanded firmness and
judicial dignity, and she felt guiltily conscious
that her recent tears would detract somewhat
from its effectiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip, however, was the first to break the
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was wondering," he remarked, "why you
raced off like that just now. Of course, there
was one explanation,&mdash;that you <i>wanted</i> to lose
the match, and were sick at having won it,&mdash;but
I wasn't such a bounder as to think that. I
smoked a pipe or two up there,"&mdash;Elsie started;
she had not realised that her cry had lasted so
long,&mdash;"and I thought it all over to see if I
could come to a satisfactory solution of the
mystery, and&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie unclosed her left hand, and displayed a
golf-ball, which she tossed towards him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;356]</span>
"There's the solution, Pip," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip picked up the ball and examined it. Then
he took another from his pocket and compared
the two.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" he remarked. "Then you spotted me.
I thought you had, but I couldn't see how. It
never occurred to me that you had found your
ball. I thought perhaps you had seen something
wrong with the one I put&mdash;took out of the hole,
but I see they are both identical. There's not
a mark on either. It was a pity you found yours.
If you hadn't, all would have ended happily,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For me or for you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For both of us."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you wouldn't have minded losing?"
This with a scornful little laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, not in this case."</p>

<p class="indent">There was another silence. That Pip should
not mind losing a match of which she was the
prize struck Elsie as uncomplimentary, not to say
rude.</p>

<p class="indent">But Pip was never rude to her. Obviously
there was something more to come. She waited
patiently. Pip gave no sign.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently feminine curiosity overcame pride,
and she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean by 'in this case'?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I mean this," said Pip. "I don't like losing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;357]</span>
matches at any time,&mdash;nobody does,&mdash;but in
this case, <i>your</i> case, I was glad."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! Why?"</p>

<p class="indent">"At first it was because I couldn't bear to see
you beaten after the plucky fight you made.
I've often felt the same thing at cricket, when
some chap is sticking in to keep the last wicket
up, and I am put on to knock it down. Admiration
for a gallant foe, and all that, you know.
But now I am glad for quite another reason&mdash;jolly
glad!" He gave the girl a look that was
quite new to her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why are you glad, Pip?" she asked, not
unkindly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I had a good long think just now, up
on that green, and a lot of things were made
plain to me that had never struck me before.
First of all, I realised that you had been quite
right."</p>

<p class="indent">"Right? About what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"About this golf-match being contrary to
Nature. Love affairs aren't built that way. I
had no right to try and force such terms on you.
I see that now. I tried to drive you into a corner.
It was a low-down trick, though I thought
it a fair enough offer at the time. I was quite
sincere."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know you were," said Elsie quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Pip raised his eyes to hers for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;358]</span>
"Thank you," he said; "it was decent of you
to say that. Now, where I made my error was in
this. I didn't think it mattered much whether
I got you willing or unwilling, so long as I <i>got</i>
you. It was <i>you</i> I wanted, you&mdash;Elsie&mdash;alive
or dead, so to speak,&mdash;nothing else mattered.
And then suddenly I saw what a fool I had been.
I had forgotten that there were two sides to the
question. When a man wins a race or a competition
of any kind, he sticks the prize up on
his mantelpiece and takes no further notice of
it beyond looking at it occasionally and feeling
glad he's got it. Once there, it ceases to have
such an interest for him: he hasn't got to live
with it or cart it about with him. I am afraid
I was looking at you rather in that light. I was
so taken up with the idea of winning you that
I forgot about&mdash;about&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"About having to 'cart me about with you'?"
said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, that's it. I forgot I couldn't put you
on the mantelpiece and leave you there: I had
to consider your point of view as well as my
own. It was then I realised, all in a moment,
that unless you came to me absolutely of your
own free will, without terms or conditions, you
couldn't come at all,&mdash;and what's more, I
wouldn't want you to; and that's saying a good
deal, as you know."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;359]</span>
He paused suddenly, and darted a rather
ashamed look at Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose all this seems fearfully obvious to
you," he said. "Most men would have found
it out for themselves from the beginning."</p>

<p class="indent">"Some men never find it out at all, Pip."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, that's comforting. Anyhow, having
reasoned it all out up there, I put my pipe in my
pocket and came along here to tell you."</p>

<p class="indent">"To tell me what?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How sorry I was."</p>

<p class="indent">"What for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For having behaved like a&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You don't look very sorry."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip's eyes gleamed.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, and I'm not either," he shouted. "I'm
not, I'm not! I have seen something since then
that has driven all my sorriness out of my head.
I came along here, fearfully glum, just to say I
was sorry to have forced such a caddish scheme
on you, and to ask if I might carry your clubs
back to the house, and suddenly I came round
the corner, and there I saw you&mdash;crying."</p>

<p class="indent">"And that's made you glad?" said Elsie
coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Glad? I should think it did!" He stood up,
and continued, "Don't you see, dear, it showed
me that you <i>cared</i>? A girl doesn't lie sobbing
on the sand if she's absolutely indifferent. Oh,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;360]</span>
I know now, right enough: half an hour ago I
didn't. I came upon you then hunting for your
ball and dabbing your eyes with your handkerchief;
but that of course was different; I knew
it wasn't the real thing. You were just tired
then, and sick at losing the game; but this time"&mdash;his
face glowed&mdash;"this time I knew it was
the real thing, and that you cared, you really
cared. Yes, you cared; you had cared all the
time, and I had never known it!"</p>

<p class="indent">He stood over her, absolutely radiant: no one
had ever seen Pip like this before. Then he
dropped down on to the grass beside the girl, and
put his arm inside hers.</p>

<p class="indent">"You do care, don't you, Elsie?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie turned and looked him full in the face,
without a trace of affectation or fear.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Pip, I do," she answered.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was long after six when they emerged from
their retreat. The clouds were drifting up once
more from the southwest, and everything promised
a wet night. There was little wind, but
already rain-drops were beginning to fall, unsteadily
and fitfully. Presently this period of
indecision ceased, and the rain came down in
earnest. The two paused, and Pip surveyed Elsie's
thin blouse disapprovingly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;361]</span>
"Isn't there some place where we can shelter?"
said Elsie.</p>

<p class="indent">"There's a sort of tin place over there, but you
would be soaked through before you got halfway
to it. Besides, this rain means business; it'll
go on all night now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Come along then," said Elsie; "we must
hurry. I can change when we get home."</p>

<p class="indent">"Wait a minute," said Pip.</p>

<p class="indent">He began to divest himself of his tweed
jacket.</p>

<p class="indent">"Put this on," he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense, Pip; you'll get soaked."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip sighed, gently and patiently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Put it on," he repeated, holding it open for
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Elsie glanced at him, and obeyed.</p>

<p class="indent">"You're an obstinate old pig, sometimes,
Pip," she remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">And so they tramped home. They said little:
there seemed to be nothing left in the world
worth saying. Pip carried both sets of clubs under
his left arm. Occasionally he sighed, long
and gently, as one who has done his day's work
and is at peace with all the world. Elsie marched
beside him, with her arms buried to the elbows in
the deep pockets of Pip's old jacket. (They were
spacious pockets: one of them was sheltering
two hands.) At intervals Elsie would look up
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;362]</span>
at Pip, upon whose head and shoulders the rain
was descending pitilessly. Once she said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Pip, you're getting awfully wet."</p>

<p class="indent">Pip looked down upon her for a moment.
Then he looked up again, and shook his glistening
head defiantly at the weeping heavens.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who cares?" he roared.</p>
